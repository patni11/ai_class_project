01/07/19,"Bloomberg is reporting that:

Japan’s financial watchdog has abandoned plans to allow listed derivatives based on cryptocurrencies but may yet approve exchange-traded funds that track the asset class, according to a person familiar with the matter.

The decision to bar instruments like Bitcoin futures or Ethereum options in one of the largest markets for cryptocurrencies marks another setback for investors betting on institutional demand to help end a brutal year-long selloff. But the possibility of ETFs tracking digital assets in Japan could revive appetite from retail investors after $500 million was stolen from Tokyo-based Coincheck Inc. a year ago.

The Financial Services Agency is currently gauging industry interest in ETFs tracking digital currencies, according to a person familiar with the agency’s thinking who requested anonymity discussing private plans. The regulator last month decided against pursuing revisions to the nation’s securities law which would have allowed crypto futures and options to be listed on major financial exchanges after concluding that such products would achieve little besides stoke speculation.

01/12/19,"UPDATE:  The puzzle [has been solved!] (not by me).  

To see the other Easter eggs I uncovered, read below.  They are interesting.  The person who solved it has promised to reveal the full riddle and I will link to it once it's available. 

-------------


Artist Pascal Boyart recently created a beautiful street mural inspired by the [La Liberté guidant le peuple] and incorporated the recent bouts of protests and unrest lead by the 'yellow jackets'.

[He's hidden 0.26 BTC in the painting] (now up to 0.29 BTC). It's up for the viewer to solve the puzzle to unlock the coins.

I happen to live walking distance from the mural and being both a lover of art and Bitcoin I thought I would investigate.  I've solved part of the puzzle, but have hit a roadblock and now asking for help from the community.


**The Rules:**

The artist has said that *part* of the puzzle can be solved from the visual. The remainder of the puzzle can *only be solved by visiting the mural in person.* 

[Take a moment to review the full image and see if anything sticks out to you.]

-------------

*Clue 1:* 

On the bottom right hand corner of the mural [is a message.]  ""SEED 12 WORDS""

The obvious interpretation here is that he's telling us to look for 12 seed words to unlock the private key.  So far so good. 

-------------

*Clue 2:*

I noticed [this part of the painting had faint brush strokes that looked like characters.]

Sure enough, playing with color inversion in Photoshop shows a [clear coded message!]

The code seems to be:  

mq+cC6A
x2+8R8LAnE
WgQnA==  

This looks like a PGP style encryption format.  There is also an email below.  I went ahead and e-mailed the artist. 

-------------

*Clue 3:*

The artist actually responded to me with [this message.]

He's suggesting I may not have the characters correct and then leaves a hint in the form of numbers: ""03012009""

On quick inspection it appears to be a date.  This translates (in euro coded dates) to Jan 03 2009... or the [date of the Bitcoin genesis block.]

-------------

**FINAL**

*Where I'm stuck and need your help*

I've run the encrypted message above through a variety of online decoders looking for a translation or additional clues.. but have had no luck.  Also it is confusing as to why the artist would link me to the genesis block date. Ideas?

Is it possible the message is encoded using the genesis block public key?  Or am I missing something more elemental?

What sticks out to you in the painting that may hint at the 12 seed words?  Remember that some will be solvable just through the image. 

Help me brainstorm here...


-------------

**Addendum**

There were other hidden messages in the painting.  I'll outline them below.

-------------

*Discovery #1*

On the [left side of the painting near the woman's arm was this coded message.]

This is a Base64 string.  You can use online tools like [this] to decode the message.

The two stings are:

1. Y29uZHVpcmU = ""conduire""
2. dHJpb21waGU = ""triomphe""

Both of these words are French and are on the [Bips-39 seed word list.]  This was my first clue that the seed words were in French.

-------------


*Discovery #2*

Above the woman are [two more coded words.]

These don't conform to Base64... and took some time to figure out.  A friend suggested the [Cesar Chiper]

Using the Cesar Chiper, this is what appears:

1. ATOUT = ""union"" at *shift 6*
2. JPAVFLU = ""citoyen"" at *shift 7*


The fact that french words emerged from the Cesar cipher and that they were *both on the list of french seed words* lent credibility to the notion that seed words are french... and perhaps the shift was a clue for order.

-------------

This is as far as I got!  

It was super fun ... and I'm very curious to know the solution... the art piece was amazing as well and worth the visit alone.

Thanks for all contributions to this thread and helping try to sort the mystery!

01/12/19,"*Research suggests that the age of coins being spent – in particularly the 1 year+ UTXO – is on the rise.*

Holders are getting stronger: over half of all bitcoin hasn’t been moved in a year. 20% hasn’t moved for five years, and much of that may be lost. [Delphi Digital] uses this information to forecast the bottom of the market is close.

Before we go further, a quick definition of terms is in order. Every time bitcoins are ‘spent’ – i.e. moved – new outputs are created on the blockchain. These outputs are chunks of coins that may be combined in a new transaction, or sent individually; it doesn’t matter. Every bitcoin transaction has inputs – coins owned by the sender – and outputs, or the result(s) of that transaction. The outputs are known as Unspent Transaction Outputs, or UTXO.

The UTXOs used for a new transaction may have been sat in their addresses for just a few minutes, or they could have been hodler coins left dormant for years. Thanks to the nature of the blockchain, and the fact that every transaction is timestamped, we can gain some very interesting insights from the ages of coins being spent. For example, if a coin hasn’t moved for five years, you know the owner acquired it back when prices were a fraction of what they were today. It’s not a precise science, but it gives us a broad sense of the initial value of coins being moved. And that, in turn, gives us a sense of whether hodlers might be tempted to sell at current prices.

01/14/19,"*Kevin Dowd, Professor of Finance and Economics in the Business School at Durham University, stands by his 2015 paper predicting the failure of the #1 digital currency.*

A [recent article by CoinDesk] discusses research by an economist that suggests Bitcoin cannot survive long term, due to two key factors.  

Kevin Dowd reached his conclusion back when the price of bitcoin was less than $400 – but he stands by it now, more than 3 years and 10x in price later. ‘My reasoning is based on two simple economic arguments. The first is that the bitcoin mining industry is a natural monopoly and a natural monopoly undermines bitcoin’s core value proposition. The second is that in markets with zero regulatory entry barriers, an inferior product cannot survive long-term. Either of these arguments is sufficient to produce my conclusion that the price of bitcoin must go to zero in the long term.’

Dowd’s arguments are well-reasoned, as you’d expect. (He’s not the first to predict bitcoin’s demise, of course.) And he states that no one has been able to refute his conclusions. ‘I have also yet to hear a single intelligent challenge to this argument from the bitcoin community. Instead, the typical response has been personal abuse. Name-calling is no substitute for a reasoned response, however.’

I was under the impression that if you have 10k of realized gains, followed by losing it all after selling at the bottom, it’s still considered 10k in gains, since you can only deduct 3,000. 

In other words, if you buy 10 btc at 1,000, sell at 11,000, that’s 100k realized gain. Then it drops to 10,000 and you buy another 10 btc and sell at 4,000. So now you had 100k realized gains with 60,000 in realized loss. Are you tax liable on the 30,000 that you made? ",0.052,0.815,0.133,0.8638
01/29/19,"This post is a bit convoluted so there’s a TLDR at the bottom in bold.  For the record, I didn’t base this on any reading or external sources, this is mostly just from my daydreams during the day.  So I am definitely not too confident about this and am looking for some critiques.

So I was thinking today about the moving averages and was fascinated with how the 9 day moving average seemed to be acting as resistance on the 4 hour chart.  This got me thinking about some questions.   What is a moving average precisely?  Why does a moving average have the price it has?

Well, the MA is the average of prices at which bitcoin was sold for over the a particular timeframe.  OK, but what does that mean?  What physical events does a moving average represent?

To help me think about what sort of physical events a moving average represents, I decided to use an analogy.  Let’s say we’re not talking about bitcoin, let’s say we are talking about apples.  Let’s say there’s a market with lots of ~~rekt bitcoin traders~~ apple sellers and the apple sellers sell their apples at different prices to buyers.  The price of the apples goes up and down based on number of buyers and sellers.

Very intuitive so far, but what’s a moving average?  Well, a moving average is the average price the apples sold for in the past on the day you were buying the apples.  So let’s just say you buy an apple at this market every day.  Assuming you didn’t literally calculate the moving average for the price of apples, your monthly moving average is just your general sense of how expensive or cheap the apples were in the month or so.  **But there’s an important nuance**.  Most importantly, the moving average is your general sense of the past price of apples *without taking into account the overall in price over time.*  Ie: assuming your memory of the apple price was just the average price without any sense what the prices were in a particular month or season, then you would be remembering the moving average.

So what does this have to do with bitcoin?  Well, replace apples with bitcoin and that’s basically what a bitcoin moving average is.  It’s the market’s “memory” of the past bitcoin price without any sense of the variation in price over time.

**Now, here’s where things get interesting.**  According to this market memory, what was bitcoin’s price in the past four years?  The market’s answer is given by the 200 week moving average, which is 3300.  But why does the market think the average price in the past 4 years is 3300?  Why is it 3300, as opposed to 6k or 600?

The reason why is because the primary influence on the market’s memory is the giant surge of buyers in 2017, which pushed the price up past what the average previously was.  [You can see it by looking at how steeply the average rose in 2017.] There’s no way the market would be anywhere close to where it is now without that surge.  Because this memory the market has doesn’t include variation, it “thinks”, in a sense, that the typical price in the past 4 years was around 3k (even though it wasn’t even close to that price most of the time) because it is anchored by the surge in buying interest that the market experienced in 2017.

So can we expect the price to stay above the moving average?  Well, the fundamental cause (the surge of buyers) that influenced the moving average above 3k are no longer present.  Therefore, I think we can expect the price to dip below the 200 week ma, and I think it’s pretty obvious from recent price action that this is where we are going.  But the real question now is how long are we going to stay below the 200 week MA?  The answer, I think is simple: to get back to the moving average, we would need a ratio of buyers to sellers similar to what the market “remembers” there being in the past 4 years.  And since the moving average is at the level it is at due to the surge of buying interest in 2017 we basically need to recreate a ratio of buyers to sellers similar to what there was in early to mid 2017.  (And there is a counterargument which I address in comments.)

So when are we likely to have that ratio of buyers to sellers?  Essentially, [similar to the bet I made in a previous post] by betting the price will go above the moving average in, say 2019 or 2020, you are effectively betting we will have a similar ratio of buyers to sellers to the ratio we had in 2017 at some point in 2019 and 2020.

I think it is likely we will not have that level of interest any time in 2019, and probably not for much of 2020.  It thereby follows that we will likely spend quarters 2, 3, and quite possibly 4 in 2019 and quarter 1 of 2020 below the 200 week moving average, meaning that until 2020, the price will not rise above 3k.  This also implies a sub 2k bottom, possibly in the low 1ks and possibly a later bubble due to the next halvening (2022 instead of 2021).

**TLDR:  the main influence behind the 200 week ma is the surge of buyers in 2017.  That means that if we dip below it, we will need a similar surge of buyers that we saw in 2017 to get above it.  This is unlikely in 2019 and 2020.  Therefore we will spend most of that time below the 200 week ma.**",0.01,0.939,0.051,0.989

01/30/19,"So I keep seeing comments lately that the sellers are exhausted and the bottom is in, and bull run is right around the corner. I'm not saying it's not, but I want to run some numbers with you, since I see many of the Bitcoin users are not aware of them:

Miners are currently adding **54k BTC** to supply every month. They need to at least cover their running costs. Let's say that the average mining cost is ~$3000, that would mean miners take **~$160 million** out of the market each month. According to a study made by Cambridge university, in 2017 there were AT MOST **5.8 million unique active crypto users** (with the drop in price, I think it's safe to assume there are less now, but let's ignore this). IF everyone of them would DCA each month, it would mean each one of them would have to put on average **$28/month** just to keep the NET inflow of cash at 0 and keep the price stable (you can call it hidden monthly fee), and this is if we ignore the regular people that sell and leave the market (if you are from a developed country and think $28 is not much, consider that a big part of the crypto users are from emerging countries, have a low standard of living and dream that Bitcoin is their way out of misery. For them, $28/month is A LOT). Judging from the price move, the Bitcoin believers are having a hard time keeping up with the miners. And as price goes sideways, or drops, more of them will abandon DCAing, and this will put more pressure on price, even if they continue to HODL. So in order to keep the price at current level, they either need to continue buying every month or convince someone else into becoming a Bitcoin believer (sounds sad but it's the truth).

So the cost of keeping the network running is still too big, considering it's barely used at anything else other than speculation at the moment. Let's look a bit in the past. The total value of BTC mined/month, after the halv(en)ing in 2016, was around **$32 million/month** (average price of $600/BTC). And the miners had a bigger profitability margin back then or were simply casual miners that didn't even sell to cover costs, so assuming the recovered running cost was around **$20 million/month**, **8 times less** than it is now, it was way easier to start a bull run with that selling pressure. Are you a pre-halving DCAer? Are you now putting 8 times more fiat in Bitcoin every month than you were doing back then? If not, have you convinced 7 other people to put aside **every month** at least the amount you put back then? 

Some more food for thought: remember that McAfee guy that predicted **$1 million/BTC** by 2020? Well, after the halving that would translate into **$27 billion** given to miners EVERY MONTH. Which means there has to be a NET inflow of fiat of this amount just to keep the price at that level. So **EVERY person on this planet** needs to contribute **~$3.5/month** to keep the price stable. Good luck with that. Gold, which has been an actual store of value for a long time and is used as a reserve by states, has an annual addition of 3000 tones which translates to **~$10 billion/month** worth of gold sold by mining companies. So, in easy to understand terms, ~$10 billion are poured in by gold bugs every month just to keep the value of it stable (inflation adjusted). If all these gold bugs would switch to Bitcoin, the price at which 1 BTC could be sustainable would be **~$185k** now and **$370k** after halving. Do you think gold will be abandoned for good and that money will be put in BTC? If so, congratulations, you're going to be rich. But the hard reality is that you may be just a day dreamer. Are you a bit more level headed person (but still optimist) and think Bitcoin will take **5%** of gold monthly inflows? That would value it somewhere around **$9k** before halving and **$18k** after. Good value compared to now, but won't make you rich. BTW, the VanEck CEO disagrees with you. He recently said gold bugs are starting to abandon Bitcoin and return to their first love.

Right now it's not easy to see these costs because they are hidden from the user due to BTC being rewarded directly to miners. But as block rewards will go down, these costs will be reflected in transaction fees. What people don't realize is that the halving won't magically cut 50% of running costs, it will either transfer it to the users through transaction fees or will result in hash rate dropping, which if price won't drop with it, will make the network highly vulnerable to attacks). Fun fact: if both price and hash rate remain stable until the halving, the transaction fee would need to be increased by **~$8** just to keep everything the same as it is now. At **$20k/BTC**, fee would have to be increased by **~$50**, and there are no plans in the near future for serious on-chain scaling to combat that. Would you open a LN channel for 50$ just to load it with 5$ to have fun with micro-payments?

So in conclusion, even if in the short run, price can deviate from the actual NET inflow of cash, creating potential bubbles, in the long run it will stabilize so that the price actually reflects it. And once the price reflects the true inflow of cash, and you add up all the numbers, you start to wonder if the cost of running it is actually worth it.",0.064,0.812,0.124,0.9971

01/31/19,"Hello again. I made this post originally in the daily, but Mr. Moonmath suggested to post it as a self-post so here it comes ;) with a few edits here and there as many people who commented gave a good input on what I wrote:

I know fundamentals is not a thing that should be discussed too much on /r/BitcoinMarkets as it's primarily about the market but as /r/Bitcoin is utterly delusional, /r/BTC is not about Bitcoin but Bitcoin Cash and /r/BitcoinDiscussion doesn't like price talks, I feel a little bit forced to write about it in here. My topic is LN and its implications on price.

There are two main aspects about Bitcoin that people seem to be interested about: on the one hand it's the ""Store of Value""-mentality, where Bitcoin is similar to gold, but in a digital form. On the other hand there is the ""Medium of Exchange""-mentality, where Bitcoin works as a global currency. In 2017 and 2018, we pretty much [peaked] in terms of transaction volume. The mempool was completely clogged and transactions took 40$+ to go through. Where Bitcoin Cash and other coins try to scale the amount of processable transactions with an increased blocksize, Bitcoins solutions are, as of now, the SegWit softfork, LN and sidechains. SegWit is actually working, but has not reached the desired block-capacity of 2,4MB. Instead it's hovering in the range between 1,1-1,2MB. It's likely because only around [40%] of the transactions are SegWit transactions. Sidechains are, IMHO, a double-edged sword and they didn't really deliver so far. If I'm wrong on this, please feel free to correct me ;) . And yes, I heard about liquid and how good it's supposed to be, but I have not seen a huge impact yet or hard facts. So what's left? LN, a possible block-size increase and scaling solutions that have not been developed yet. As the block-size increase needs a huge majority of the Bitcoin-participants to agree on a hardfork and its terms, this might take a very long time. We can't discuss about scaling-solutions that don't exist yet, so let's just talk about LN and some numbers.

So we want to assume that Bitcoin scales up to Visa levels of transaction-capacity ( **if** we believe that Bitcoin is more a medium of exchange than a store of value). /u/CONTROLurKEYS pointed out that there is no real incentive to stop using your credit-card if Bitcoin really takes off. I agree to disagree on this point as I'd feel much more safe if I could decouple myself from any company(!) who tries to profit off of me doing transactions. I'd rather give my money to the miners than to banksters but that's just me. Going on: looking at the [numbers] there are roughly 900 million Visa credit cards out there. Assuming that every card belongs to one person, we get 900 million visa users. For my calculations I'm going to use 1,000 million users as an approximation because it's easier to handle in calculations. If everyone of those 1 billion users wants to make micro transactions via LN, we'd need at least 1 channel for every user. That would be 1 billion channels minimum. Assuming that hubs are going to have many channels to other hubs and that there are going to be smaller hubs that don't acutally act like a user but simply as a payment processor, there are going to be many more channels. But for the sake of argument, let's assume that, to serve 1 billion people, we'd need 1 billion channels.

So now let's talk about what a micro-transaction is and what the least amount inside a LN channel should be. Many people take the coffee transaction as the standard example for a micro-transaction. That example is okay'ish, but when you think about it, it's not only coffee-transactions that happen on a daily basis. People go to supermarkets, pay their bills, buy fuel for their cars and so on. Considering that we're processing around [300k] transactions per day, we **have** to categorize those payments also as micro-payments. If everybody of the 1 billion users would clog the blockchain with their bread and butter purchases, we will get nowhere with a 1MB blocksize. So what is the worst purchase that you're doing on a daily basis when you think about the price of that transaction? My biggest day to day transaction would be buying fuel for my car. The cost for that is easily 100$. So if I want to do this payment via LN, my channel would need a balance of at least 100$ in form of BTC. 1 billion channels at 100$ would be 100 billion $.

If we look at the LN capacity now, the capacity is very very small in comparison to the available supply. Let's say 10% of all BTC ever available lands inside LN channels. Yes, this is a number I pulled out of my ass, but if you compare the amount of money you have in your cash-wallet in comparison to your net worth or your savings in your bank-account, that would also be less than 10%. More like 1% or less. Let's play it through with both scenarios and let's say that only 1 million BTC is lost forever so the math gets easier.

LN Capacity in % of total Bitcoin supply: 10% = 2,000,000 BTC

1,000,000,000 channels à 100$ would be 100,000,000,000$ in LN channels (which is not considering the big player money between the hubs).

For this scenario to actually work, BTC price would need to be 50,000$...

LN Capacity in % of total Bitcoin supply: 1% = 200,000 BTC

1,000,000,000 channels à 100$ would still be 100,000,000,000$ in LN channels (which is still not considering the big player money between the hubs).

For this scenario to actually work, BTC price would need to be 500,000$.....

In addition to that, the numbers I took were chosen in a way that BTC price would **not** look too ridiculously high. 100$ per channel for example is IMHO not that much if you really want to pay for groceries and fuel and all the other daily stuff without a need to refund the channel every few days. I track every penny I spend and earn each month and the numbers for me, if I refund my LN channel each month would be: 200$ for food + toilet paper + other consumables, 200$ for car bills + fuel, 50$ for hobbies, 100$ for other forms of transportation, 50$ for my mobilephone-bills + Amazon Prime + barber. That would be already 600$ total. I don't mind refunding my LN channel each month with that much money as the money is going to be spend on those things anyways and is in some form already tied as monthly expanses. Let's just say I pay 400$ in rent for my appartment so the numbers add up again, that would be 1,000$ in my LN channel. Yes, if you think about it, it appears dumb to pay rent via LN. But on the other hand, if 1,000,000,000 people would broadcast a blockchain-transaction for their rent each month, the blockchain would be clogged in no time again. 100$/channel in comparison to 1,000$/channel adds a factor of *10 to the calculations above. Consider that every person in the world would use Bitcoin and LN? Add a factor of *8 to both scenarios. You think LN capacity will be less than 1% of total Bitcoin supply? Add another factor. You think more than 1,000,000 BTC is lost for ever so the supply is even less? Add another factor.

If you take the most conservative model where 10% of Bitcoin supply at a max of 20M BTC (which is actually not going to happen bc more BTC than that are lost) would be in LN, 1/8 of the population uses LN for there daily transactions and their channels have each 100$ in it, we'd end up with a market cap of 50,000$ * 20,000,000 = 1,000,000,000,000 = 1 trillion$. That's the most conservative assumption on marketcap considering that LN is going to work as promised and gets as much adoption as E-Mail got in the uprising of the internet. I'm not posting these numbers to spit moon juice all over the place but to put things into perspective. 1 trillion$ is not a small amound of money but not too big either if you think about a global digital currency. Taking 1/2 of the population, channel capacities per person of 1,000$, LN capacity at 1% of BTC available with max 1,000,000 BTC lost forever:

LN Capacity in % of total Bitcoin supply: 1% = 200,000 BTC

4,000,000,000 channels à 1,000$ would be 4,000,000,000,000$ in LN channels (which is still not considering the big player money between the hubs).

For this scenario to actually work, BTC price would need to be 20,000,000$ which would put the mcap to 400,000,000,000,000$ or 400 trillion$. Which is basically fifty times the mcap of all the gold in the world.


What I'm trying to say is, **if** you guys and gals are really thinking that LN is going to work out the way everybody promises, and all the little things that are still a little bit hard like refunding channels from different parties and routing bigger amounts, Bitcoin would actually need to be priced in the range of X00,000$ - XX,000,000$. At that point you really don't need to trade it and just throw your money into this thing. So if you **really** believe in LN and that LN is going to be the TCP/IP of Bitcoin just go all in. I'm definitely pro Bitcoin and I also think that a very big majority of altcoins are not adding any value to the world, but the numbers and calculations above just seem utterly ridiculous. 20,000,000$/BTC? I mean come on... basically everybody in this subreddit would be a millionair if the LN-promises are going to be met. In addition to that /u/gr8ful4 pointed out, that opening 1,000,000,000 channels would need 1,000,000,000 blockchain-transactions. Let's say we process 333,333 transactions per day. That would mean that we would need 3,000 days for just **opening** those channels and we're not even considering closing channels and all the other transactions that are happening on-chain.

If I have any logical mistakes or wrong assumptions let me know and let's discuss a little bit. The price is not doing exciting things anyways. ",0.053,0.878,0.069,0.9865

A lot of investors invested money in any company which had business with blockchain. Today this word doesn’t have such a tempting sound. Nevertheless, technology turned the business, and the growth of cryptocurrency promised a future outside the traditional financial system.



The blockchain has future in IT-sector of the economy. And it will save the cryptocurrency as the payment for using it. Previously, Bitcoin's price had a specular character. It is becoming brighter than its market value now.

02/01/19,"So a few days ago I made [this post] and, after making it and reading your comments and thinking some more, I had some additional thoughts that I felt were worthy of their own post. 

So after reading some people saying that bitcoin hasn’t gone below the 200 weekly ma and that the 200 ma should act as strong support it occurred to me that the 200 ma literally isn’t the same 200 ma as it was during the previous bear market.  During the previous bear market, the 200 ma took into account prices from the entirety of bitcoin’s history.  Now, however, the 200 ma only takes into account prices from about 40 percent of bitcoin’s history.   

It then occurred to me that if we are going to make price predictions based on moving averages, we should look at the moving average that was equivalent to the 200 ma during the previous bear market.  That moving average is the 100 week ma.  The 200 week ma is about 4 years and bitcoin is 10 years old.  The 100 week ma is about 2 years and bitcoin was 5 years old during the previous bear market.

So I took a look at these moving averages and the results paint an eerie picture.

First of all, to further establish the similarity of the 100 weekly ma to the 200 weekly ma, I want to [post a chart of this moving average during the very first bear market] the one after the bubble to 32 dollars. As you can see, we did not go below it during the first bear market, and, in fact, moving averages [close to the 100 weekly acted as support during the first bear market] just like the 200 weekly did.  And of course, during the first bubble, the 100 weekly spiked massively like the 200.

So if the 200 weekly ma (an ma that acted as support when it averaged almost all of bitcoin's price history and averages the same percentages of prices now as the 100 ma did during the last bear market) acts the same as the 100 ma, then what does the 100 ma tell us will happen.  Well, [here’s a chart]  As you can see, the price broke the 100 ma and spent a year below it hovering around the 150 week ma.  It thereby follows that that the price will likely spend upwards of a year or so under the 200 week ma before the bear market is over.  (I also posted the rsi in that chart.  More on that later.).

Before I move on, I want to point out that the above chart gives us some perspective on timeframe and the size of price action.  We hugged the 100 ma for over 2 months before breaking below it, then, after we did, it took almost two months to finally bottom out.  **Even more importantly, the price of bitcoin dropped by half over that time period, from the upper 3ks to the upper 1ks**.*  Thus, if we drop from 3500 to 1750, this should surprise no one, bitcoin clearly can drop by huge amounts during bear markets and if it happened before, it can happen again.  

Now, if bitcoin is going to act similar to the previous bear market relative to moving averages, what, then, is the equivalent of the 150 and 200 week moving averages currently?  They are the [300 and 400 week moving averages, and this is where they are]  So, in theory, once we break the 200 ma, we should dump to the 300 and 400 ma’s which in the lower 2ks and upper 1ks.  Thus, based on historical analysis of the moving averages, we should expect a bottom in the upper 1ks, with us perhaps spending several week long periods dipping above and below 2k over the course of 2019.  Bitcoin only needs to drop an additional 50% for this to happen so this is certainly possible.

I also want to add that sentiment supports us finding a bottom in the 1ks.  In my previous thread, it is pretty clear the majority of people believe that the bottom will be in the 2ks.  Thus, if we actually did bottom in the 2ks, this would surprise no one.  Breaking 2ks and going into the 1ks would be a test that would really cause a lot of people to capitulate and truly flush out the weak hands.  

Finally I want to talk about rsi and its interesting behavior right now compared to what we are doing in the previous bear market.  As I pointed out [in this post] it is very rare for rsi to spend a [long time in the lower 4k to upper 3k region]  Indeed, it only did that in the previous bear market. Currently, we are forming a similar plateau in the rsi (just look at the charts in the previous post if you’re interested).  **But perhaps most interestingly, when we were hovering above the 100 week moving average, we were on the first rsi plateau in 2015**.  We’re currently hovering above an equivalent (in some ways)to the 100 week ma and are on a similar rsi plateau right now.

Anyway, my point is that the moving averages and rsi are showing some very interesting similarities.  They suggest that over the next 4-6 months, we will dump to the upper 1ks before finding support on one of the longer term moving averages.",0.031,0.899,0.071,0.9856

02/08/19,"I have been trying my hand at Bitcoin futures trading lately. I used Bitmex previously but recently tried out the new Kraken Futures platform. I found an odd difference that I really can't explain. In the past with Bitmex when my position was liquidated everything was taken. But when I opened a small position with Kraken Futures and my position was liquidated, I received an email saying I had a difference between my sold collateral and what I owed on my position. The email stated that the difference in funds was going to be returned to me, and when I checked my trading wallet a portion of BTC was still there. As I said earlier with Bitmex when my position was liquidated my entire funds were taken. 

So now I am confused, is it normal in BTC futures trading that you are supposed to get back the difference when your position is sold off in a liquidation? Is this something specific to Kraken futures or do other futures trading platforms do this? And what happened to the difference in my funds from Bitmex when my position was liquidated?

02/11/19,"The IRS opened their e-filing on January 28th and many people are now filing their taxes.

While the new tax laws have changed a few things this year, most rules regarding cryptocurrencies have remained the same.

If you are new to including cryptocurrency in your tax returns, or just could do with a refresher, here are 10 useful pieces of information.

## 1. Profits from cryptocurrencies are capital gains

A tax event occurs whenever you dispose of any cryptocurrency. For each event, you have to calculate if you made or lost any money. These are declared as capital gains/losses (Schedule D) on your tax forms.

This includes:

* selling crypto for fiat currency, e.g. trading it on an exchange for dollars
* trading one crypto for another, e.g. buying ETH with BTC, as you are disposing of the BTC
* spending crypto, e.g. buying a gift card

If you didn't receive a dollar amount, such as when selling for USD, then you would use the *fair market value* of the crypto at the time. This might be how much it was worth, or the value of the item you are acquiring. For example, if you buy a $100 gift card, then the fair market value of the BTC you are spending is $100.

It also doesn't matter if you traded and never withdrew the USD to your bank, or received crypto to your own wallet. If the account is under your control and you would have access to the received funds, then it needs to be declared. It also doesn't matter if it is a US or foreign exchange. For US taxpayers, all activity must be included.

## 2. Long-term gains have discounted tax rates

If you sell or spend your crypto that was owned for more than a year, it can be classed as *long-term* and any gains made will have discounted tax rates. The rate depends on your other income, but can be 15% or even 0% for lower income taxpayers. There is a 20% rate for high income earners.

You will need to keep records in case you are even asked to prove you owned them for longer than a year.

## 3. Losses can be offset against income to reduce taxes

To calculate your total capital gains, your short-term gains and losses are combined. Then any long-term gains and losses are combined. Finally, these totals are combined into a net gain or loss.

If you have a net loss, you can use it to deduct up to $3,000 against your normal taxable income, for example, saving $720 in taxes with a 24% tax rate.

Any remaining losses are carried forward to next year. They can again be used to reduce capital gains from that year as well as another $3,000 against income. This continues forever until you have used up all the losses.

## 4. Like-kind exchanges

Trading between cryptocurrencies is a tax event and you cannot use a 1031 like-kind exchange.

The new tax law in 2018 has changed the [wording] to:

&gt;*No gain or loss shall be recognized on the exchange of* ***real*** *property held for productive use in a trade or business or for investment if such real property is exchanged solely for real property of like kind which is to be held either for productive use in a trade or business or for investment.*

While some people reported using like-kind exchanges for 2017 and earlier, it definitely cannot be used for this tax year and onward.

## 5. Record forks, splits and airdrops

Any crypto you receive is treated as income on the day it was received. The dollar value is its fair price or market value.

While some crypto may have an established price, often, there is no market or known price. In this case, you should still add the crypto as Income, but for zero value.

This is needed for when they are eventually sold or traded, as you will use the date and amount from when they were acquired to work out the appropriate gains.

## 6. Being paid in cryptocurrency should be reported as if you received dollars

If you are paid with crypto, you should report the income as if you were paid in dollars. If you were paid by an employer, it is likely the figures have already been included in your W2 and there is nothing else you need to do.

But if you received crypto from self-employed, or other work, then you need to report the fair value as your income. For example, if you did some work that you would normally have been paid $1,000, but instead you received crypto, then you report $1,000 as income in your taxes. If you just received some crypto with no equivalent dollar value, then you must use the fair or market price of those crypto on the day you received them.

## 7. Tips/gifts aren't taxable

If you were tipped, as long as it was *not* for any provided product or service (i.e. you didn't earn it), then it is gift and does not need to reported and is not due income taxes.

However, if you were tipped or gifted crypto that you subsequently sell or trade, you will incur capital gains.

If you were given the cost basis along with those gifts, you can use this information to reduce any gains when you come to sell them. However, you cannot take losses from the basis of these coins, but instead have to use the market value on the date you received the gift.

## 8. Transfers do not have to be reported (but fees might)

When you transfer any crypto between various wallets or exchange accounts that you own, you do not need to report or pay any tax on those amounts.

However, you might need to report any fees associated with the transfer, either mining or withdrawal fees. These are disposals, where you are paying for a service, and so should be included as Spending even though the tax amount is likely negligible.

If you were transferring your crypto to an exchange to sell, you could add this to its basis, or deduct it from the proceeds you receive.

Any fees included for spending from a wallet should be included as part of the fair market value. For example, if you are spending 0.01 BTC on something worth $36 but have to include a mining 0.001 fee, you should record this as spending 0.011 BTC for $36.

## 9. Identify lost, stolen or fraudulent activity

Prior to 2018, stolen property could be claimed as a deduction by reporting it as a *casualty loss* (subject to certain amounts). This deduction has been removed and now is only available for presidential declared disasters.

While lost crypto could never have been claimed, as accidents or negligence are not tax deduction, losing crypto because of fraudulent activity could instead be seen as a capital loss. For example, if the crypto had become worthless or you are no longer able to access it.

Each situation is different and you should check with your tax professional to decide how to report any lost crypto due to fraudulent activity.

## 10. Keep records

You should keep records of all your crypto activity in case you are ever audited or required to show documentation relating to your tax returns. For example, you might be required to prove the long-term gains you declared were owned for more than a year.

The burden is always on you to keep documentation and perform record-keeping.

Recently, we have seen exchanges go offline and users have no access to their historical records, or even funds. You should access your accounts and download your data as frequently as needed.

* Keep records of all your cryptocurrency activity.
* Periodically download your trading history from any exchanges you use.
* Export transaction logs from any wallets you have.
* Ensure you have records for each time you spend any crypto.

02/12/19,"Hey guys. Not sure if this is the right sub to post so lemme know if there's a more appropriate sub that I should be asking this. Does anyone know why on Binance,  there is currently a $40 premium on the BTC/USDT pairing? For example right now PAX/BTC, USDC/BTC, and USDS/BTC pairs are approx 3575 but the USDT/BTC pairing is at $3620 .

One thing I've learned recently with the whole Quadriga CX fuster-cluck is that if there's a premium there might be a reason to shy away. Tether is tied to Bitfinex which has ties to Quadriga CX along with many of its own uniquely shady issues. I'm hesitant to use the tether pairing vs PAX because of the tie to Bitfinex but it's hard to ignore a higher value. I chose not to trade on Bitfinex despite their even higher premium due to the recent Quadriga issues. Binance seems safest option to me right now.

02/14/19,"Bloomberg is reporting on the rise of derivatives trading among digital assets firms and miners alike. It's a typical ""doom-and-gloom"" article from them, but nonetheless provides interesting insights into how some miners and digital asset funds and firms are staying afloat by trading options, futures, and covered calls.

Article URL: 

From the article:

Desperate to survive the collapse of their market, cryptocurrency diehards are reaching into the financial tool kit to raise some old-fashioned cash.

They’ve begun selling derivatives linked to digital tokens to squeeze something out of their depreciating assets. Their need is so acute that ventures run mainly by software developers and tech experts are negotiating the terms with financial pros who earned their chops on Wall Street.

It’s the cost of surviving what’s come to be known as the crypto winter—and a stunning turnaround from the mania that drove Bitcoin up by 1,400 percent in 2017. The most valuable token is down about 80 percent from its peak. For the other side of the trade, it’s an inexpensive way to bet on a rebound.

(...)

Interviews with a dozen crypto traders and investors from New York to Sydney yielded a variety of estimates on sales volumes, from $125 million per month to $500 million, and differing views on whether the main users are professional counterparties trading between themselves, or the miners who create the digital assets and other large token holders.

(...)

While the market has grown rapidly, some traders point to burdensome constraints. Since there are no market standards, counterparties typically demand significantly more collateral than would be required for options on more widely accepted traditional currencies, according to Rich Rosenblum, co-founder of GSR, a Hong Kong-based algorithmic trading firm focused on digital assets.",0.048,0.822,0.129,0.9745

03/01/19,"I recently interviewed Jon Stead, a CPA who specializes in cryptocurrency  margin trading. Figured this would be a good place to post the interview, as well as some highlights for anyone who prefers reading to listening. He offers a simplified explanation of margin trading, as well as some strategies for being successful at margin trading. 

Full disclosure, I work for BitcoinTaxes and the link below links to our podcast page.

[BitcoinTaxes Podcast Link]

Highlights:

**Margin trading can be a complex concept to those unfamiliar with it.** *\[03:17\]*

Jon: Margin trading is the process whereby you take a speculative position   using a loan. So if you want to make a bet that Bitcoin is going to go   up in value, for instance, instead of clearing out your savings account   to buy Bitcoin, you would take out a loan and use the loan to buy the Bitcoin. That's the difference between ordinary trading and margin   trading - you are doing it with somebody else's money.

Most   of the time if you want to trade on margin, you need to have an  account  with a broker. In the case of a cryptocurrency margin, you need  only  have an account with a particular exchange that supports trading  on  margin. There's going to be requirements for collateral. Just like  in  any loan, there's going to be an interest expense.

**When trading on margin, there are long positions and short positions.** *\[04:52\]*

Jon: In plain English, if you want to take out a long position on margin:   let's say you think Bitcoin will go up - you borrow $1,000 from a bank   and buy one Bitcoin that is trading at $1000. Then wait three months. At   the end of three months, you have one Bitcoin and you owe $1,000 plus   interest at the end of three months. Let's say Bitcoin is now trading  at  $2,000 - you sell the Bitcoin and now you have $2,000 in cash and  you  owe $1,000 plus interest. You payback your thousand dollars, you  pay the  interest, and you keep the change.

Short   positions are much more fun and much more dangerous. So let's imagine   that you want to short Bitcoin and Bitcoin is trading at 1000 bucks   today. You borrow one Bitcoin. So now you're holding one Bitcoin and you   owe one Bitcoin. You sell the one Bitcoin for 1000 bucks and then hold the cash and then wait three months. At the end of three months you  are  holding $1,000 cash and you owe one Bitcoin, plus interest  denominated  in bitcoin. So let's say that Bitcoin is now trading for  500 bucks. You  take your thousand dollars cash and buy, let's say 1.1  bitcoin for 550 -  you pay back the one Bitcoin that you owe, pay back  the 0.1 Bitcoin in  interest and keep 440 US dollars. That's a short  position - you've  borrowed what you think will go down, sold it for USD  and wait, buy it  back cheaper, pay back your interest and keep the change.

**Understanding your margin trades becomes a lot easier if you can understand the resulting ledgers.** *\[11:09\]*

Jon: The one that I that I find the easiest is the Kraken ledger. So I'll use this as the example. All of the other exchanges that do margin trading are roughly similar.

When you export a Kraken Ledger, it's going have every transaction that you did. Now the trades are going to come up in two pieces and the category is   going to be called ""trade"". Let's say you bought 1 ETH for 1000 bucks -  it'll say ""trade"", ""ETH"", ""1"". The next line down will say ""trade"", ""USD"", ""-1000"".

Now on the margin side, there are two categories that will show up. One of them is called   ""rollover"", and the other one is simply called ""margin"".

Let's   take roll over first. If you are trading on margin and you don't cash out your position, you're essentially letting it ride. So if you go  long  on Bitcoin and you win, and now you've got 0.2 Bitcoin in your  exchange  and you want to let it ride and bet again, you're going to be  charged a  rollover fee. The rollover fee is usually going to be  denominated in  crypto and there's just going to be a giant ledger full  of them.

The  other thing that you'll  see is just simply called ""margin"". The margin  category is going to  have a quantity value - the quantity value will  either be positive or  negative and it'll have a denominator. So if you  look in your Kraken  ledger and it says ""margin"", ""2"", ""BTC"", that means  that you took out a  margin position, you won your bet, and your winnings  from that bet is 2  BTC. Obviously the reverse is true here. If it says  ""margin"", ""-2"",  ""BTC"", you lost your futures position.

**If you want to be successful at margin trading crypto, Jon says four factors come into play** *\[21:50\]*

Jon:   If you're going to trade on margin, and your approach is just to throw   money at it and hopefully something sticks, you're going to lose your   money. But there's another approach. And the other approach is to take   it like a poker player. Now a poker player needs four things in play, and all of them need to work to win.

The   first thing you need is a strategy. And the strategy has to actually  be  good. If your strategy isn't going to work, it doesn't matter.  You're going to lose money.

The second  thing  you need in order to win on margin, when you're approaching it  like a  poker player, is discipline. Anybody can write down a strategy  and  believe it, but when things start getting difficult, a lot of  people  second guess themselves. You have to have your strategy and it  has to be  the one you work all the way through your trade. When your  trade  doesn't work, use the feedback and reorient your strategy. Don't  go  reorienting your strategy mid-trade. That's like trying to reorient your golf swing in the middle of the swing - it’s not the right time  for  that.

The third aspect that you  need is  patience. If you don't have any patience, you should not be  trading on  margin. And that's because if you don't have patience,  you're going to  go doubling down on your bet while it's still alive.  Not a good idea,  right? You need to have a long-term strategy approach, approach it with  discipline, and also let the strategy work in real  time and be patient  about it.

The last  thing that you need  is liquidity, which is to say you need cash to  backup your gain. The  example from poker would be if you're a good  poker player, you have your  proper strategy, you're a disciplined, cool  headed poker player and you  have patience, - but you also need the  chips to ride out a bad poker  player’s lucky streak. Any bad poker  player can hit a pot once or twice -  it's going to happen. If you are a  good poker player and you don't have  the chips to ride that out, it  doesn't matter that you're right in the  long-term...you're not going to  be able to ride it out in the  short-term.

**Jon   utilizes his expertise with our previous guest, Alex Kugelman. If you want to reach out to Jon, the best way to do so is to get in touch with Alex.** *\[38:14\]*

Jon: I work for Alex Kugelman. In the case that you want to talk to me, you’ve got to call or email Alex at Alex@KugelmanLaw.com. He's also on Bitcoin.Tax if I'm not mistaken. Reach out to Alex, set  it  up through Alex, and he'll put it together. The benefit of that is  then  the attorney-client privilege extends to me, through Alex.

Go through all their interactive 'we'll guide you'  stuff until you you are asked about 'Investment Income',  1099B or broker statements.  It will ask you all kinds of questions,  play close attention and answer correctly.  


There are three basic scenarios:  


1) You get 1099B from your brokerage,  and that represents ALL of your crypto taxable events

2) You don't get a 1099B from your brokerage,  and you have crypto taxable events

3) You get a 1099B from your brokerage,  and you have additional,  unreported crypto taxable events.

The best way to determine if you did things correctly is to review your return after it's done.  If you did things correctly your tax return will contain one or more 8949 forms.  

Scenario 1 and 2,  you should have one form 8949 in your return

Scenario 3 you should have TWO form 8949s in your return.

03/14/19,"So I recently had this, [very interesting discussion] with u/Nothink.  He posted [this log chart] which shows that the entire crypto market cap is in a large descending channel.  

It also shows that the top of the descending channel for the entire crypto marketcap is intersecting with a long term ascending trendline.  This suggests that we are reaching a critical point.  Either the total crypto market cap will break our ascending trendline that we have followed for years or we will continue down our descending channel.

We should not trust the crypto marketcap to continue to follow the ascending trendline.  I've [extended the trendlines from u/Nothink's chart out and this is what we] find.  

In order for crypto to maintain the market cap growth shown on the ascending trendline, then we will have to have a **minimum** total market cap by July comparable to the market cap in in late October 2017.  To put that in perspective, bitcoin's price was above 6k in late October.  And that's just three months from now.

Furthermore, in order to continue to maintain that trendline, the total crypto market cap has to have a comparable market cap by January 1st, 2020, to the market cap we had at the end of November, when we were in full bull run mode.  **And that is the minimum market cap necessary just to maintain our current logarithmic trend on the crypto market cap.**

Thus, if you believe the long term market market cap trendline will hold, you are basically making a bet.  You are betting that by the end of the year, market conditions for crypto will be similar to market conditions (ie, a giant speculative bull run) in the 4th quarter of 2017.  It is obvious that this will not happen.  This is not March of 2017, this is March of 2019 and I would hope some people here can recognize the difference.  

Retail got massively burned at the end of 2017, and more people got burned at the end of 2018.  Furthermore, it may take a very long time for institutions to even start going into crypto in large numbers, just look at how many times bakkt has been delayed.  It is very unlikely that we will have a bull run comparable in intensity to the bull run of 2017 in 9 months.  Thus, it is a good bet that the ascending trendline will break and the upper channel of our descending channel will hold.  

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This bet, by the way, [is identical to a bet I made five months ago when we were at] 6k.  We were faced with a similar ascending trendline on the  logramithic price chart, that showed the price being at 20K by the end of 2019.  I argued that it was a good bet that we would not have another bull run by the end of the year because retail had to recover, and thus, we had to break down from that trendline.  

**The bet behind us dumping by mid-April is literally identical to the logic of that 6k breakdown prediction**, and that prediction worked out pretty well.  You have literally seen this movie before.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

One more thing.  Let's just say we do dump in early April.  Assuming we respect the descending channel we are in, and we bounce off the lower trendline of that channel, then by late April/early May, we should have a market cap that is about half the market cap we have now.

If bitcoin follows the market cap and dumps by half its price, that should give us a price in the upper 1ks around 1900 dollars.  I have argued [several times] in this sub [that bitcoin is likely] to test the long term moving averages like the 400 or 450 weekly ma's before the bear market is over.  This is because have tested longer term moving averages in previous bear markets.

If bitcoin follows the total crypto market cap, the we will dump to levels that will allow us to test those moving averages.  Thus, betting that the crypto, and thus, bitcoin's, market cap will dump soon not only makes sense from a market cap trendline perspective, it also makes sense from an historical analysis of the moving averages.

**TL;DR:  If you bet that the long term crypto market cap trendline will hold, you are betting that we will have another crypto bull run within the next 9 months.  Do you really want to make that bet?**

**Edit:**. I’m getting a lot of flack for using the total crypto market cap instead of the total bitcoin market cap.  However, if you look at the total bitcoin market cap on log view, you come to the same conclusion.

03/16/19,"Episode 06 of the BitcoinTaxes Cryptocurrency Taxation Podcast Series examines the complexities involved in investing in and trading ICOs. Our guest, Marc Boiron, has a vast amount of experience with ICOs, from both the investor and issuer point of view. Marc shares his unique perspective on ICOs, STOs, and where he sees the future of both going.

Guest: Marc Boiron

Topic: ICOs &amp; STOs

[Link to Episode]

Summary:

**Marc’s practice has been focused entirely on the crypto and blockchain space since 2017 - his experience and knowledge is uniquely multi-faceted.** *\[00:40\]*

Marc: I got interested in Bitcoin in 2015, on a more technical level than anything else. It's all I wanted to talk about and think about. Since the second quarter of 2017 my entire practice has been in the blockchain and crypto space, doing work with individuals or businesses. There's the work on ICOs and STOs. There's work on crypto funds. There’s work that I'll do on just generally using cryptocurrencies in an ecosystem outside of the context of an ICO. I'll do some work on exchanges. Lastly, I work on mining farms - contract work or working with partners on leases and real estate related issues. Really kind of broadly across the spectrum.

**ICOs &amp; STOs may seem similar, but there are some important distinctions to understand.** *\[2:26\]*

Marc: Generally speaking, I think of an ICO as anything where a cryptocurrency or utility token, that is not a security, is being sold. That’s different from an STO where you can think of it as anything that is a security that is being sold. That might be a utility token that happens to be a security anyway, or that can be something that is intentionally a security in terms of equity. In between the two, where it's very convoluted, is where you've got instruments like a SAFT (Simple Agreement for Future Tokens) that converts into a token that is intended to not be a security. I usually throw those in the ICO category, where it's kind of a private ICO, but in the end you have a token that is not a security.

Often people think of an ICO as a public sale to a broad number of people. I think of an ICO also to include a private sale where a company is going to a few investors, or a large number of of private investors, usually high net-worth individuals, and selling oftentimes, and almost exclusively now, a SAFT.

**Generally, both the ICO issuer and the ICO investor are going to be taxed based on the cost basis to develop or acquire the coin and the coin’s fair-market value.** *\[04:40\]*

Marc: Generally speaking an ICO is going to be taxed. I think of it like you're selling a product. The IRS has said that utility tokens, specifically Bitcoin and other virtual currencies, are property. The general view has been that utility tokens will be treated in the same way. You're selling property, which means that it is like selling a widget - a company will sell a widget and get taxed on the value of that widget, the fair market value or the price at which that token specifically is sold. Most of the time there's very little cost that went into developing that token. There’s essentially a zero basis being the cost, and a fair market value being the price of what it was sold for. The tax is going to be the difference between the two.

For individuals, if we talk about a token that's actually been purchased - you know what your cost is at that time. If you've purchased it for $1, your basis is going to be $1 - at least at the time of that purchase. When you go ahead and sell it for $2, then you have a $1 gain.

**Understanding the taxation of ICOs and airdrops requires knowledge of the regulatory framework underlying them.** *\[8:00\]*

Marc: Most people know that a security is a defined term in the Securities Act. One of the terms that is included in the definition of securities is an investment contract - which depends on whether it meets certain factors in the Howey Test. Those factors are whether there's been an investment of money in a common enterprise, with an expectation of profit, based predominantly on the efforts of others. When you look at that in the context of a traditional ICO, I think it's pretty clear there's an investment of money - something is being given to the company in exchange for those tokens. In a common enterprise, everyone who's contributing to that ICO is in the same pool and their risks, in terms of profit or loss are going to be pooled together. There's going to be an expectation of profit - that’s how almost all ICOs are sold. And, it's going to be from the efforts of the issuer who is actually selling them.

When you take an airdrop, the question becomes, is there an investment of money? The factor that we usually take for granted as present in an ICO, might not exist in an airdrop.

If you look at a true airdrop, where there is no whitelisting, and you're not giving your name and email address - one where you just happened to get a new token in your wallet. The investor doesn't give anything up whatsoever. So there's a really good argument that there hasn't been any investment of money. Now the problem with that is the SEC very likely going to disagree with you. In addition, there's no affirmative support for that argument. There's nothing against it, but there's nothing actually affirmatively saying that's okay.

**Fair launch projects may be the answer to these regulatory hurdles.** *\[14:14\]*

Marc: I put GRIN in the category of a fair launch project because when the network was launched, nobody had any allocation of tokens. Nobody had any benefit that others didn't. Everybody had an equal shot at it and there's no central party that is going to go ahead and manage GRIN itself. For that reason there's a really good argument that that “efforts of others” prong of the Howey Test is not satisfied, because there is no central party that is providing the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts. The argument would be that a fair launch project like GRIN, and the tokens that are received by miners in the network, that there's really no security there. I think that's a pretty good argument.

**The SEC has been strict on ICOs, for good reason - but the regulatory framework behind ICOs can still be difficult to interpret.** *\[16:45\]*

Marc: We have kind of come full circle to a point where now the SEC is saying, yes, we can have something that is not a security. When does that happen? That is extremely unclear - under the “sufficiently decentralized” test, when are you sufficiently decentralized? I get this question all the time and it's frankly impossible to know when you're considered to be sufficiently decentralized. Frankly, what does the term decentralized really even mean? You know, a lot of people say “oh, we are decentralized”, which is true at a technical level, but not at from a managerial perspective. You're not - you've got a central system that is marketing all of this. That's kind of, I think, an interesting development in terms of how you're actually going to try to analyze this.

Essentially, what hasn't been answered at all, is how do you get to a point where you are sufficiently decentralized but comply with securities laws?

**With regulations that are confusing and somewhat subjective, are ICOs going to decrease in popularity amongst issuers and investors?** *\[29:35\]*

Marc: Most successful ICOs now are raising one or two million dollars. It's a very tiny market. That being said, I expect it to continue when it comes to any kind of protocol - anything that truly, absolutely needs a token. I see protocols continuing to grow and token sales related to protocols continuing to grow. I see everything else shifting more towards STOs and internal tokens. Internal tokens are nothing more than reward points. Something that people think is more efficient to have on the blockchain. They will not be listed on exchanges.

**Federal laws are complicated enough, but things get even more dicey when you factor in any state laws regarding securities.** *\[34:04\]*

Marc: Instead of using the Howey Test for determining what is a security, around a dozen states use something called the Risk Capital Test. Essentially that test pretty much looks at are you putting the capital of somebody at risk? I think there are quite a few situations in which you might have a security under state law, that is not a security under federal law.

**Most STOs are being sold the traditional way securities are sold - representing equity in a company.***\[37:42\]*

Marc: With a STO, you're going to go out and actually sell a security. That security could technically be a utility token, but what we're seeing is that there's not really much interest in a utility token being sold as a security. Frankly, there'd be a lot of issues with its use. Most of them are being sold the way traditional securities were sold, representing equity in a company. Oftentimes these are startups, some of them are companies that hold real estate, and it's intended to represent ownership in that real estate. Same thing with art. We're starting to see more discussions around debt. So essentially what you'll have is a company that's going to follow traditional securities laws.

The implications relative to ICOs are that most STO investments are all traditional, in that their value is going to be tied to an underlying asset or the performance of an underlying asset - maybe the future cash flow of a property or a company. Unlike an ICO where there's lots of different models as to how a token might be valued, and how its value might grow.

**It’s generally up to the investor to understand if they are investing in an ICO or STO, and the implications that surround each type of investment.** *\[43:40\]*

Marc: It's definitely on the investor. The investor needs to always be diligent and figure that out. If they are diligent, and they can't tell the difference, then there's probably some kind of liability there for the issuer - it should be very obvious. For issuers, if you're selling a utility token that is not a security, then you shouldn't need to have the same level of disclosures as you would with a security token.",0.064,0.825,0.11,0.9984

[Bitcoin \[BTC\]] has struggled to hold on to earlier attempts to gain a position above $4,000. Yesterday, bitcoin \[BTC\] rallied to just above the psychological barrier with a 4% rise within 24 hours. The trading volume topped $11 billion, the highest since last April when the bitcoin price was trading at over $8,000.

Experts in the cryto space predicts that the bitcoin bull run will happen once the Bitcoin \[BTC\] price touches $4,600 and the much anticipated market boom is expected to happen in March. $4,600 is possibly the beginning of the Bitcoin bull rally.

A prominent cryptocurrency anlyst and trader, DonAlt shared in an interview that bitcoin bull rally will begin when the price reaches $4,600. He explained that the recent rise in the price of Bitcoin and [Ethereum] brought hope in crypto space and crypto investors.

He further explained that the first generation cryptocurrency has to break the $4,600 and go up to $5,000 and $6,000 further. Bitcoin winter still continues till the price reaches $4,600. If it breaks the point, crypto analysts can confirm that the 15-month old bear market is ended.",0.02,0.91,0.07,0.8176

03/22/19,"Strategy purpose:

On February 15, Binance announced the taking off announcement of the CLOAK, MOD, SALT, SUB, WINGS. After the announcement, the currency involved immediately began to fall, generally down 15% in an hour, with more and more users knew the news, the decline continued and there was no rebound, and it has fallen by half so far. If you can sell the coins held in the first time after the announcement, you can recover a lot of losses.

This strategy runs on the FMZ quantitative trading platform (formerly BotVS 

Idea:

Crawling down the Binance security announcement pages and observe the information of the nearest two times of announcement. The specific format is “Binance will delist CLOAK, MOD, SALT, SUB, WINGS”, “Binance will delist BCN, CHAT, ICN, TRIG”.

The strategy will use the ""will delist"" as a keyword to crawl the new release announcement, of course, does not rule out the Binance change notification format, you can refer to this strategy to improve. Since the crawler task is too simple, it will be written in simple JavaScript. After crawling down the delist currency, the account information will be checked. If there is a delist currency, it will be sold at a lower price. If there is an uncompleted order, it will be revoked first. Until the sale of the remaining coins is completely sold.

Crawling code：
```
var html = HttpQuery(' page
html = html.slice(html.indexOf('article-list'),html.indexOf('pagination')) // Article list section
if(html.indexOf('will delist')&gt;0){
    if(html.slice(html.indexOf('will delist')+3,html.indexOf('&lt;/a&gt;')) != title){ //crawl only the first delist information
        var title = html.slice(html.indexOf('delist')+3,html.indexOf('&lt;/a&gt;'))
        var downList = title.split('、')
        Log('New announcement is detected, the currency will be delist：', title, '@')//WeChat push release announcement
    }
}
```
Revoking order code：
```
function cancellOrder(){
    var openOrders = exchange.IO('api', 'GET', '/api/v3/openOrders')//Get all unexecuted orders
    for (var i=0; i&lt;openOrders.length; i++){
        var order = openOrders[i];
        for (var j=0;j&lt;downList.length;j++){
            if(order.symbol.startsWith(downList[j])){
                var currency = downList[j] + '_' + order.symbol.slice(downList[j].length);
                Log('There is a delist currency order exist, revoked', currency)
                exchange.IO(""currency"", currency)//To revoke a order, you need the trading pair information, so you must first switch to the trading pair.
                exchange.CancelOrder(order.orderId)
            }
        }
    }
}
```
Check account code：
```
function checkAccount(){
    var done = false
    while(!done){
        account = _C(exchange.GetAccount)
        done = true
        for (var i=0; i&lt;account.Info.balances.length; i++){
            if(downList.indexOf(account.Info.balances[i].asset)&gt;-1 &amp;&amp; parseFloat(account.Info.balances[i].free)&gt;pairInfo[account.Info.balances[i].asset+'BTC'].minQty){
                Log('delist currency will be emptied', account.Info.balances[i].asset)
                sellAll(account.Info.balances[i].asset, parseFloat(account.Info.balances[i].free))
                done = false
            }
        }
        Sleep(1000)
    }
    Log('Sale completed')
}
```
Placing order code：
```
var exchangeInfo = JSON.parse(HttpQuery('
var pairInfo = {}  //Trading pair information, storing transaction progress, minimum trading volume and other related information, placing order will needed
if(exchangeInfo){
    for (var i=0; i&lt;exchangeInfo.symbols.length; i++){
        var info = exchangeInfo.symbols[i];
        pairInfo[info.symbol] = {minQty:parseFloat(info.filters[2].minQty),tickerSize:parseFloat(info.filters[0].tickSize), 
            stepSize:parseFloat(info.filters[2].stepSize), minNotional:parseFloat(info.filters[3].minNotional)}
    }
}else{
    Log('Failed to get transaction information')
}
function sellAll(coin, free){
    var symbol = coin + 'BTC'
    exchange.IO(""currency"", coin+'_BTC') //switching trading pair
    var ticker = _C(exchange.GetTicker)
    var sellPrice = _N(ticker.Buy*0.7, parseInt((Math.log10(1.1/pairInfo[symbol].tickerSize))))
    var sellAmount = _N(free, parseInt((Math.log10(1.1/pairInfo[symbol].stepSize))))
    if (sellAmount pairInfo[symbol].minQty &amp;&amp; sellPrice*sellAmount pairInfo[symbol].minNotional){
        exchange.Sell(sellPrice, sellAmount, symbol)
    }
}
```
To sum up:

The above code is only for demonstration, the complete code can be found at FMZ.COM. The announcement page can be crawled once in a minute, which will have enough time to sell before the ordinary user.

But there may be some problems, such as crawling being blocked, announcement format changes, and so on. If the currency is not on the Binance, you can also refer to this strategy to other exchanges. After all, the delist currency will affect all platforms.",0.025,0.958,0.016,-0.7126

So, I interviewed a tax professional well-versed in FBAR &amp; FATCA reporting requirements for crypto traders. Below is a link to the actual podcast, and then a summary of the interview, with timestamps in case you want to just fast forward to a certain part. Full disclosure, I work for Bitcointaxes.   


[BitcoinTaxes Podcast Link]

Guest: [Andrew Gordon, ESQ.]

Topic: FBAR &amp; FATCA Filing for Crypto

Summary:

Our  guest, Andrew Gordon, is a tax attorney who understands the ins and  outs of foreign account reporting in relation to cryptocurrency trading.  Andrew joins us to discuss FBAR &amp; FATCA reporting, the penalties  associated with not reporting, and to address whether he believes crypto  traders should be filing these forms.

**Andrew has been working in the crypto-space since 2014.** *\[00:24\]*

Andrew:  Actually several years ago, ago in 2014, we had a client approach us  who was getting paid ""magic internet money"", from the Ethereum  Foundation. Back then the IRS had not released any guidance - it wasn't  till later in 2014 that the IRS even defined Crypto as property. That  was our first introduction and we were and presented the question of,  well, if I'm getting paid these random tokens called Ethereum, how do we  account for this?

**In  terms of foreign account reporting, there's two main forms you need to  know about: FBAR &amp; FATCA. The FBAR is a separate form that is due  the same day as your returns.** *\[02:42\]*

Andrew:  FBAR is my favorite four letter word. It stands for ""Foreign Bank  Account Report"". It isn't actually filed with your tax return. It's a  separate form. It's filed online, electronically. It has the same due  dates as your tax returns - April 15th and it can be extended six months  to October 15th. So same due dates, but it's filed differently, still  sent to the Department of Treasury - it's a separate form.

On  the FBAR form, what taxpayers have to do is they have to identify the  maximum value at any time during the tax year of their foreign bank  accounts. If that value at anytime exceeded $10,000, you have to report.  The FBAR is an informational form, which means that there's no tax  actually owed.

**There are popular exchanges that ARE considered foreign entities and some that are NOT considered foreign entities.***\[04:15\]*

Andrew:  Unfortunately, it's not that easy because a lot of exchanges don't even  make their address public - it's pretty hard to find. Even just as a  starting point, I would list out all of the exchanges that you've used  and try to use Google to find their addresses.

There's  a couple that we know are considered foreign financial institutions at  this point, and the most popular is Binance. In addition, many people  suspect that Bitfinex has kind of self-reported themselves as a foreign  financial institution and their information is being shared with taxing  authorities.

Coinbase, Gemini, GDAX, and a number of others are considered a US-based institution.

**The FATCA form is 8938, and is part of your tax-return.** *\[06:15\]*

Andrew:  It's very similar to the FBAR, but it's not exactly the same. One of  the first differences is that the threshold for FATCA is higher. For the  FBAR, your aggregate maximum holdings have to exceed $10,000. Aggregate  meaning that when you add your bank accounts or crypto exchanges  together, the maximum during the year exceeds $10,000.

The  FATCA threshold, for a single person, is $50,000. FATCA, just like the  FBAR, is an informational form, which means again, there's no tax due.  The government just wants to know the maximum value of each account. One  of the other differences is that FATCA is more general, so FBAR only  requires foreign bank accounts to be recorded, whereas FATCA is both  bank accounts and foreign assets.

**There's no tax involved with these forms - but there are significant penalties for not filing when required to do so.** *\[07:57\]*

Andrew:  The penalties for not filing an FBAR can be very severe. One of the  most basic penalties for not filing an FBAR is $10,000 per year - for  non-willful offenders.

If you were  willful and you just disregarded your requirement to file? Well then the  penalties can be even higher - up to 75% of the maximum value of your  account or your exchange values. It can be very severe. So while there's  no tax, the penalties are much greater. It's one of those things to do  to comply with the rules.

The FATCA form also has similar penalties.

**The burden of proof for ""non-willfulness"" is on you.** *\[10:14\]*

Andrew:  To be able to prove that you are not-willful is very difficult. In  general, if you file and sign your tax returns, you are signing under  penalties of perjury that everything is correct. You have an obligation  to know the requirements and just saying ""I didn't know the law"" is not  sufficient proof of non-willfulness.

**If  you've exceeded these limits in previous years, but didn't file these  forms, there are still feasible options to consider…but these options  may not last forever.** *\[16:25\]*

Andrew:  I would suggest that if you met these requirements in earlier years,  take corrective action to amend or file the returns properly. There are  some IRS programs that are available to come forward and file these  forms for earlier years with a reduced penalty - or in some cases, no  penalty at all.

[Bitcoin \[BTC] price has been fluctuating in the past one week.

03/28/19,"I spend at least a couple hours each day on Reddit, gaining info on my Crypto investments, so I thought I’d share how I went ahead and filed US taxes this year. 
TL;DR I used Zenledger.io to calculate my gains and losses using FIFO to populate my tax forms. I DID NOT HAVE TO DO ANY MANUAL ENTRIES. But if you have more than 300 transactions from 2018, you need the Desktop TurboTax. 

Also, duh, I’m not an accountant, CPA, or tax expert, so keep that in mind!

The first thing to understand is if you have “realized” gains or losses from Crypto. Even if we hate it, the law says that buying cryptocurrency with cryptocurrency is a taxable event. I know some of you will never pay taxes, and that’s fine. We’re all grown folks here. But I will say that I was surprised how little of my crypto was considered “realized” once I actually saw the year-end numbers. 

I’ve used a couple of the major exchanges (Coinbase, Kraken) and also an Exodus wallet (I was prepared for the pre and post ICO buy in ERC20 coins to be a mess). ZenLedger.io has a lot of help articles and videos to review on how to import transactions from exchanges and wallets, which help immensely. If you’re using a more obscure wallet, you can upload those transactions with a custom csv or manually enter them directly into the platform. You’ll want to review all the transactions (they prompt you to do this in the interface) once you think everything is in. Just do a gut check: “Did I really buy X amount of Etherum at 2 am on a Tuesday night?” or “Does my final balance match what is in my exchanges?” The software should do most of it for you, but spend 10 minutes reviewing. Worth it. 

When all your trades are in and you pay for your 2018 tax year, you can download the 8949 form (make sure to keep a copy for yourself) AND you can download a Turbo Tax-ready file. You’ll need the Desktop version if you have more than 300 transactions (I’d assume that’s a lot of us). Use Turbo Tax as you normally would, and when you get to the part about income, there is a prompt for additional income, and a prompt to include Cryptocurrency. A bunch of the tax companies have integrations now, and there are 8 or so to choose from. When I selected “ZenLedger,” you’re promoted to upload your .txt file you downloaded from them. This is your capital gains report, and TurboTax is smart enough to populate the 1099-B form with my trades.

And that’s about it! I live in Mississippi and there wasn’t anything on the state returns that I had to do, that I noticed. (Again, NOTA TAX PROFESSIONAL HERE)

If Reddit just isn’t the right place for you to get tax advice, ZenLedger has a CPA suite, where you or your CPA can use the software for you. Pretty cool, but the software is still gonna save you money on your CPA’s bill. 


Let me know if I messed up something about this in the comments. Again, just a private citizen and not a tax professional, who likes to learn how to save money, on taxes and elsewhere.",0.024,0.865,0.111,0.9925
03/29/19,"Hey guys - I interviewed Drew Kernosky about crypto tax reduction strategies. He talks about mining deductions, crypto-backed loans, and qualified opportunity zones (which can let crypto traders defer their gains for years, and then even pay a reduced amount on them). I think a lot of crypto traders will be interested, and probably surprised, at how useful these strategies can be for them. If the summary piques your interest, check out the podcast.

Guest: [Drew Kernosky of Archer Tax Group]

Topic: Tax Reduction Strategies; Crypto-Backed Loans &amp; Qualified Opportunity Zones



Summary:

Cryptocurrency  capital gains can be an extra source of income,  however these gains  are taxed, and the taxes can become costly for many  crypto traders. In  this episode, we speak with Drew Kernosky of Archer  Tax Group, to  discuss ways to minimize these tax burdens using  crypto-backed loans  &amp; qualified opportunity zones, which can give  traders a way to  defer gains until 2026.

**Our guest, Drew Kernosky, has been in the tax industry for six years, and has been working in the crypto space since early 2017.** *\[00:29\]*

Drew:  I've been in taxes for probably six years now, in a variety of   different capacities. I worked for one of those “if you owe $10,000 or   more to the IRS, give us a call”. I’ve worked in cryptocurrency since   the beginning parts of 2017.

I’ve used  that expertise, and that backing in understanding the law  and how the  IRS goes after things from a procedural standpoint, to guide  our  clients to the best cases for them, but not to where they're taking  an  unnecessary risk. Our firm applies that knowledge to crypto.

**Cryptocurrency income is taxable. There are ways to offset some of that income by utilizing deductions.** *\[03:05\]*

Drew:  When you receive a token, you would receive it as ordinary  income.  You'd subtract all of your expenses - and ideally, you'd have  enough  expenses that eat up all that gross revenue so that you've got no  net  profit, or at least an ordinary loss. The benefit to that is you're  not  going to pay any income tax on it then and also you've got a higher   basis on your crypto. So whenever you sell your crypto for less than   you acquired it for - whether that's by buying it, mining it or   receiving it for services, you actually end up creating a capital loss.

**For crypto miners, deducting your mining equipment isn’t always viable.** *\[04:20\]*

Drew:  If you are selling the mining equipment at a loss and create a  capital  loss because you were holding it as an asset, then yes, you can   actually take that against your crypto gains. But as far as the actual   mining losses - so let's say, you spent $10,000 to mine $6,000 worth of   Bitcoin, you've technically got a an ordinary loss of $4,000. It's not   going to directly offset the capital gain like a capital loss would.  But  when we run it through your actual return, we're going to reduce  your  overall income by the $4,000 that you've lost through the  business.

**Generally speaking, deductions are listed on Schedule C - and there are quite a few items in the crypto world that may qualify.** *\[05:31\]*

Drew:  If you've got the equipment, electricity, and everything else,  you're  going to want to put that in your Schedule C if you're an  individual.

Maybe  you've got a cell phone that you can depreciate the actual cell  phone  because you're paying the payment plan on it. Most people don't  realize  that they can take the full value of their cell phone if they're  using  it almost exclusively for business. Most crypto people I know  were  checking their phones every 30 seconds, checking market prices,  maybe  running some software through their phone to check their uptime on   their miners, or security. That’s all deductible.

The  more that we can find it to stack against the revenue, the better  it  will be for the actual minor because they'll generate a loss that  isn't  going to be capped like capital losses.

**Crypto-backed loans are a great way to pull value out of your existing crypto, without triggering taxable events.** *\[07:36\]*

Drew:  The idea of being behind a crypto-backed loan is when you are  using an  asset to secure a loan and you're not liquidated in any way,  kind of  like a home loan, you're not going to get taxed on the value  that you  pull out of the equity. So if you're trying to really push for  long  term capital gains and you still want to trade the market, it's a   really great way to pull the value out of your existing crypto without   triggering any kind of taxable event - provided that you're not having   an a liquidation event.

**Qualified Opportunity Zones (QOZs) may be the answer to many crypto-traders qualms about high capital gain taxation.** *\[11:50\]*

Drew:  QOZs are probably the greatest gift out of the Tax Cuts &amp;  Jobs  Act. They're all over the country. The general idea is if you've  got a  capital gain that you reinvest within 180 days of the date of  sale,  into a QOZ, you can defer that capital gain until the end of 2026 -  as  you hold the investment in that zone. That investment can be either a   building that you improved substantially or a business that operates   primarily in that zone. There’s a couple of other caveats too.

**QOZs give crypto traders and investors an opportunity to defer, and actually decrease, their capital gains.** *\[14:20\]*

Drew:  The other kicker too, after five years, they give you a  decrease on  the recognition of that gain. At year seven, they get an  additional 5%.  If they hold the asset for 10 years, the fair market  value of that  asset becomes the cost basis. It gives them that chance to  exit with  zero capital gains at year 10 year, 20 year 30 and I think  year 40 as  well. There's a lot of potential there.",0.052,0.796,0.152,0.9988

**20-APR-2019 Cryptocurrency (Elliott Wave): Easter Update**



**12-MAY-2019 Cryptocurrency (Elliott Wave): Sell In May And Go Away?**



____

The 2018 cryptocurrency crash saw Bitcoin decline 85% in value, elapsing the course of 363 days —just two days shy of a complete year. The all-time high occurred on 17-DEC-2017, and a notable low occurred on 15-DEC-2018. 

The bear market of 2018 unfolded in three stages:

* i. A three wave A-B-C decline, from 17-DEC-2017 high to 06-FEB-2018 low, declining 70%
* ii. A five wave A-B-C-D-E sideways rangebound triangle, from 06-FEB-2018 to 24-JUL-2018
* iii. A five wave impulsive 1-2-3-4-5 decline, from 24-JUL-2018 high to 15-DEC-2018 (06-FEB-2019 orthodox) low, declining 63%

Overall, these three stages form a complex A-B-C composite structure, as the following chart illustrates:

* 

As each stage of the 2018 bear market unfolded, bounces became diminishing in size. The following lists notable price advances that occurred whilst price action was rangebound in a sideways triangle during the second stage:

—06-FEB to 20-FEB, a 99% advance.

—01-APR to 05-MAY, a 55% advance.

—29-JUN to 24-JUL, a 47% advance.

Subsequent bounces during the third stage of the bear market, from 24-JUL-2018 to 15-DEC-2018, have been less than 27% in size.

From the 15-DEC-2018 low, Bitcoin has thus far rebounded 70% —the second largest advance since the 2017 all-time high. In addition, although not conclusive yet, price action appears to be advancing in impulsive waves. Hence, there is a preliminary cautious opportunity to suggest a new cryptocurrency bull market may be underway.

From an Elliott Wave perspective, a new bull may likely suggest the following two abstract scenarios, 'simple' and 'complex':

* Scenario A (Simple): 
* Scenario B (Complex): 

New all-time highs would suggest a simple scenario, where five Primary degree waves complete beyond the 17-DEC-2017 high; i.e. Primary-1 completed at the 2013 high, Primary-2 completed at the 2015 low, Primary-3 completed at the 2017 high, Primary-4 completed at the 2018 low, Primary-5 currently underway. 

A failure of the bull market to create new all-time highs would suggest a complex scenario. Such a scenario would propose a cyclical (i.e. short-term) bull market, in an overall ongoing deflationary secular (i.e. long-term) bear market. The 2018 low would be labelled as Primary-W, the current potential 2019 bull market as Primary-X, followed by the resumption of the secular bear market labelled as Primary-Y to break below the 2018 low. Complex composite wave structures are often behaviours of commodity and currency markets. 

At present, the simple scenario has been adopted until further development of wave structure.

These buddies haven't even touched crypto in the last year so I can't ask them these questions. 

I haven't put fiat in since Q1 2018. I logged into my (never-used) Gemini account the other day to discover they had an Android app out. Not only that but I logged back into Coinbase over a week ago for the first time due to a Coinbase Earn invite and I noticed a lot had changed and they support ""free"" crypto conversions too.

I do remember having to use GDAX to bypass some of the Coinbase fees but it looks like those got changed to where I don't have to do that anymore.

The  end of the tax season is quickly approaching, and this will be the last  entry in our current podcast series (don't worry, we've got a new  cryptocurrency series coming soon!). This podcast was created to answer  and explore some of the complex questions surrounding cryptocurrency  taxation. For the final entry in our Cryptocurrency Taxation Podcast  series, we are answering questions, from customers, about using  Bitcoin.Tax. Colin Mackie, CEO &amp; Founder of Bitcoin.Tax, is with us  today to help answer these questions, and to talk about some of the  upcoming features of our software.

Colin  created Bitcoin.Tax in 2013 to solve a problem for himself, and for the  cryptocurrency community. Since then, Bitcoin.Tax has expanded rapidly,  continues to grow, and improving to suit the needs of our customers.

**Questions &amp; Answers**

*\[For the full answer, navigate to the portion of the podcast as indicated by the timestamp next to the question\]*

**Q:  What information goes in the Spending Tab? If I didn't make any  purchases using crypto, do I still need to import my exchange data into  the Spending Tab?** *\[02:12\]*

A:  Any non-trade where you are spending crypto to purchases goods (e.g., a  gift card) or paying for services (e.g., paying for food delivery).  Tips and donations are also entered in the Spending Tab, and can be  categorized as such.

**Q: How do I report lost or stolen crypto? Will this count as a loss?** *\[04:25\]*

A:  Lost and stolen crypto can be added to the Spending Tab. This will  remove the cost basis of that lost/stolen crypto, but the fiat worth of  the crypto will not be deducted from your capital gains.

**Q: How do I report coins that are at zero (worth zero now)?** *\[07:25\]*

A:  Some zero-worth coins can be added to the Trading Tab as a zero-sale.  However, this is a highly situational situation - always consult with a  tax professional to assess what should be done about zero-worth coins.

**Q: When do I use your Standard CSV?** *\[08:42\]*

A: When you are trying to add data from an exchange or wallet that is not inherently supported by the system.

**Q:  If I transfer a coin from a wallet (whether it be purchased with fiat  on Coinbase or mined) to another exchange and then sell it on this  exchange, I will end up with an unmatched transaction. How do I  reconcile it? Where do I enter this data in your software?** *\[10:49\]*

A:  This will not result in an unmatched trade, as long as you enter the  source information showing the coin's acquisition as well as the data  showing where/when/how it was disposed of. If the coin was purchased on  Coinbase, transferred to a wallet, transferred to another exchange, and  then sold on that exchange, you would only need to import your Coinbase  data and import the data from the exchange that the coin was sold on. If  the coin was mined, the mining income would need to be added to the  Income Tab.

**Q: What is the most common reason for an unmatched trade?** *\[13:05\]*

A:  The most common reason is a lack of data. Other common reasons include  incorrectly entered data, incorrect times and dates, timezone errors,  missing fork/income data, and one coin using multiple symbols.

**Q: When is the appropriate time to use the ""address"" function?** *\[24:05\]*

A: The address function is meant to pick up data that you aren't able to import any other way.

**Q: Where do you get the price for crypto from?** *\[25:20\]*

A:  Prices typically come from the exchanges itself, when data is imported.  If the software needs to do a price check for an asset, we use our own  pricing data (going back to 2010) from various exchanges and sources. We  use a weighted daily average from these sources.

**Q: Why does Turbotax Online have a 250 line limit?** *\[27:24\]*

A:  We can't speak for TurboTax Online, but this is likely a limit set in  place to ensure that their users can upload their data without an issue.  TurboTax suggests aggregating the data, and so we offer aggregation  options in response to this limit.

**Q: I only ever invested 5,000 dollars, why does my report show a cost basis and proceeds in the hundreds of thousands?***\[31:35\]*

A:  1099-K forms, from exchanges, typically only show proceeds. Any time  you sell or trade a coin, your proceeds go up by the fair market value  of that coin, even if you traded the coin at a loss. It's important to  remember that proceeds are not an indication of how much money you've  profited trading cryptocurrency. The important figure, and the one that  is taxed, is the capital gains (proceeds - cost basis).

**Q: If I need a larger plan than I originally paid for, do I have to pay the whole price of the new plan?** *\[34:30\]*

A:  No. You only have to pay the difference between the plan you currently  have and the plan you want to upgrade to. This can be done by going to  Account -Plan.

**Q:  I bought and held some crypto back in 2016 and 2017, but didn't sell  them until 2018. Do I need to buy plans for all those years?** *\[35:27\]*

A:  It depends on if you need to report your taxes for 2016 and 2017. If  yes, then you will need to purchase the plans for 2016 and 2017 in order  to export the reports. If not, and you only bought crypto with fiat in  those years, you can enter the data into 2016 and 2017 for free. You  would also have to purchase 2016 and 2017 (as well as any year) if you  did trade crypto for other crypto. All trading data from every year  needs to be imported to properly calculate your gains.

**Q: How do I account for forks?** *\[37:45\]*

A:  Forks can be added to the Income Tab. If the forked coin has a fair  market value at the time of the acquisition, you can enter that value as  income. If it does not, you can enter it as a zero-cost acquisition.  Entering a fork as zero-cost is essentially deferring the tax on it  until it is traded, in which case, you will incur the full amount of the  proceeds as a capital gain.

**Q:  I bought some crypto back in 2017 but never withdrew any money, just  traded some other alt-coins. Do I need to report anything?** *\[39:53\]*

A:  Buying crypto for fiat is not a taxable transaction, in itself. Once  that crypto is disposed of for fiat, for another crypto, or for goods or  services, then a taxable event occurs. If you only bought crypto for  fiat, you do not need to report this, but you will need to keep the  records of these purchases so that you have a cost basis when you do  dispose of the crypto.

**Q: Bittrex recently announced that they are closing down in New York state? Do I need to do anything?** *\[42:20\]*

A:  Download and export your data from them ASAP. In addition, it's always a  good idea to consistently back up your trading records from all  exchanges, in case they close down or you lose access.

**Q: What are some of the new features coming to Bitcoin.Tax?** *\[44:28\]*

A:  Enhanced accuracy on coin pricing (from daily average to hourly  average), new exchanges being supported, new CPA version  (white-labeling), and calculations of maximum values on foreign  exchanges for FATCA/FBAR reporting.

**20-APR-2019 Cryptocurrency (Elliott Wave): Easter Update**



**12-MAY-2019 Cryptocurrency (Elliott Wave): Sell In May And Go Away?**



____

Since the 15-DEC-2018 low, the Bitcoin markets have rebounded with a 75% gain into Easter 2019 —quite a resurrection from the 2018 bear market which saw an 85% decline in value. With price action unfolding in impulsive waves thus far, it is becoming increasingly apparent to suggest a bull market is underway.

A simple Eggiott Wave model would propose a five wave structure, consisting of three advancing bull market waves, interwoven with two declining bear market waves. Overlaying this model onto Bitcoin suggests:

    Wave 1: the first bull market wave 2010-2013 (1219 days), followed by;
    Wave 2: the first bear market wave 2013-2015 (426 days), followed by;
    Wave 3: the second bull market wave 2015-2018 (1065 days), followed by;
    Wave 4: the second bear market wave 2018-2019 (363 days), followed by;
    Wave 5: the third and final bull market wave 2019-?

The five aforementioned have been considered as PRIMARY degree waves —such waves elapse the course of a few months to a couple of years.

Timewise, the first two bull markets (Waves 1 and 3) elapsed 1142 days on average; and, the first two bear markets (Waves 2 and 4) elapsed 395 days on average. Bull markets have lasted almost three times longer than bear markets. Thus, an intuitive linear projection would propose the current third and final bull market (Wave 5) to complete by the year 2022 or earlier. However, since the current fifth and final Eggiott Wave is by typical definition only required to revisit or just exceed the high of the third wave, it may suggest the current bull market may be comparatively contracted in price and time.

The first Bitcoin halving occurred on 28-NOV-2012, approx midway through the first bull market. The second Bitcoin halving occurred on 09-JUL-2016, approx midway through the second bull market. The third Bitcoin halving is tentatively scheduled for 21-MAY-2020, perhaps midway through the third and final bull market or at the end?

A common wave relationship guides the price of the fifth and final wave to be equal to, or extend a Fibonacci 1.618 times the length from the low of the first wave through to the high of third wave, projected from the low of the fourth wave. This provides a conservative target of the current bull market to conclude between $22912 and $35127 calculated using the BraveNewCoin (BNC:BLX) index…

    @22912: PRIMARY[5] = (PRIMARY[1] + PRIMARY[3]) * 1
    @35127: PRIMARY[5] = (PRIMARY[1] + PRIMARY[3]) * 1.618

* BLX: [

Projected from the 15-DEC-2018 low, the aforementioned conservative price targets are a 630% to 1020% gain, or 825% on average. The average gain alone would be sufficient enough to qualify the current fifth and final PRIMARY\[5\] wave which would exceed the 2017 high of the third PRIMARY\[3\] wave, albeit marginally.

However, for the popular altcoins like LTC and ETH, an 825% gain projected from their 2018 lows would only retrace half of their respective bear markets. Even a 1000% gain in LTC and ETH would fail to match their 2017 all-time highs. Furthermore, there are altcoins such as LTC where the 2018 bear market low overlapped the high of their respective 2013 bull markets highs. Such a price overlap negates an impulsive wave structure, and thus would suggest a corrective wave structure as follows (indicative of price/structure, not time):

* LTC: [
* ETH: [

The short to medium term wave structure of Bitcoin thus far appears to be impulsively advancing from the orthodox 06-FEB-2019 bear market low, with maximum pullbacks at 11% on average. Four waves seem to have completed which have been classified as MINUTE degree —waves of such degree elapse from a few days to a week:

    24-FEB: MINUTE[i]
    27-FEB: MINUTE[ii]
    10-APR: MINUTE[iii]
    15-APR: MINUTE[iv]

* BTC: [

The third MINUTE degree wave which completed on 10-APR, itself subdivided into five smaller impulsive waves classified as MINUETTE degree waves. A decline below the low of 15-APR would suggest MINUTE\[iv\] pullback is still in progress which ought to find support at the low of 04-APR. Otherwise however, it appears the final MINUTE\[v\] degree wave appears to be currently underway. Once MINUTE\[v\] completes, the first MINOR degree wave of the bull market will have completed, and the first largest pullback of the bull market will commence —perhaps an approx 30% decline. At this point in time, price will be required to decline to the 24-FEB high to terminate the proposed wave structure, and quite possibly the bull market. The degree of wave labeling is currently tentative and subject to revision (i.e. may be either upgraded or downgraded in degree); however, the waves remain fixed.

Hi r/BitcoinMarkets , I am the owner of [taughtu] and we post trading and business articles every week teaching people something new.



Since the market has been heating up lately, I wanted to share an article we recently did on fundamental analysis in crypto that I think you will enjoy! Definitely a must read before alt season.



\------------------



One of the most overlooked skills in cryptocurrency, Fundamental Analysis, is the minimum one requires to preserve their capital in a highly volatile market like crypto.

But what exactly is it?



**Introduction to Fundamental Analysis**



If you are good at SWOT analysis, or at least know what it is, then you are already on the right track.



Traditional analyses do not work in crypto, in that a single day can wipe off billions of dollars from a project’s valuation or ‘pump’ its value by 2-10x in a day during an ‘altseason’ (yes, *we will* see one again).



Generally speaking, one has to modify the traditional SWOT analysis and calibrate it to suit one’s own style. Moreover, the ‘standard framework’ is not suitable for crypto assets. How exactly, would obviously depend on what you are looking for in a project. More on that later.



How will you get better at it? The more you analyze projects and try to find their shortcomings, the better you will become, and during this process, develop your own ‘style’. The rationale to look for shortcomings in a project is due to the fact that no project will highlight their weaknesses (and what is funny is, many projects know their weaknesses but do not care).



Hence, starting to look into a project with a negative bias is always beneficial.



There are three pillars to fundamental analysis in my opinion:

1. The project itself
2. The ‘blockchain level’ competition
3. The real world industry/application domain the project is targeting



**1 - The Project**



It is crucial to know first, what exactly is the project trying to achieve.



Many projects’ homepage doesn’t even say that. Knowing what the project aims to do would help you figure out whether the project is really required, or, can it really survive and become a full fledged currency/company.



Then comes the investigation about the team, its composition, experience, vision etc. Has the team ‘doxxed’ itself, if not, do they have a solid reason for that? Are the team’s linkedin, githubs available for review?



A team which is open about their experience gets plus points from me. But it is always a double edged sword, in that some projects which are at nascent stage, and no information about the team might go on to give the most returns due to undervaluation resulting from the uncertainty about the team.



E.g. – Luxcore project went parabolic due to this factor, as people were betting heavily on ‘what if factor’ about the team.



Interestingly, my favorite cryptocurrency project has an anon team still, even though I have a decent investment in them. 

My reasoning is that I am willing to take that risk, and having seen their work, I am confident that the devs know their game, and team disclosure in future will only help the project’s credibility, not the other way around.



To conclude the first point, I will come to the main question –



*Is this project really required?*



We have so many privacy clones, PoS projects, ‘DAPPs’ projects (biggest meme of them all), ‘fast transaction’ based crypto currency and so on. The top 200 is overcrowded, and full of similar ideas, and I believe 80% of them will eventually die.



The goal is to find the ones with a high chance of survival. So the idea has to impress me, generally in the *first 2-4 minutes.*



Personally, if it is not unique enough, or ambitious enough, my excitement and attention starts to dwindle. *And all this is before I even open the white paper*. The amount of time and deep dive I do into the white paper depends on the above process.



Whitepapers, in general, are intended to describe the project to a layman. What I have observed is, most people tend to skip any mention of technology/algo/implementation, thinking ‘I do not have a technical background’, and this is where some get it wrong.



Spend some time to investigate those terms/ideas (Google is always your friend, IF we do not get into the data stealing aspect).



By this time, one would be in a position to ascertain what exactly the project aspires to do, and the real world problem they are trying to solve.



Essentially, a project has to solve a real world problem, or a problem with the blockchain technology itself, or improvise upon an existing idea by a big margin.



**2 - The Competition**



This is the most important factor after the initial ‘vetting’ of the project.



A good team will always know their competition, and focus on doing things better than them, and innovate further. If this is not true for a project, then the ONLY thing going for the project would be the difference in the respective valuations.



For e.g. ,why do we need a new privacy coin, when we have projects like Monero and Zecash, which have progressed quite a bit technologically, have a big community backing them, and of course significant cash stockpile.



To build up on this example, most privacy clones will die, leaving the space for the innovators to capture. There are various factors which have to be considered when we compare a big cap incumbent and a low cap challenger (to be discussed in subsequent articles).



Personally, I am always inclined to bet on low/micro cap projects aiming to take on the more established ones, and envision to take the innovation to next level.



To elaborate, consider an example – If project A is at $500 million+ (IN A BEAR MARKET), and a microcap, lets call it project B, have technology parity, or slightly better technology(project B), then I see no reason for it to not grow to compete with A.



This is exactly where the most gains are made.



But there is a risk associated with this approach – what if there is a mega ‘FUD’ hitting the project, or team gets entangled in financial issues, or maybe goes under 51% attack etc.? Some examples being $CAL, $XHV etc.



If a microcap’s reputation takes a beating, it takes them significantly more time to regain credibility than their big cap competition (more on all these points in the next article).



To wrap up this section, success of a project also highly depends on the competition, market dynamics, and the community backing it. 



**3 - The Real World**



Now even though fully decentralized organizations are at least 7-10 years away, for me, a project has to solve a real world problem, or a problem with the blockchain technology itself.



For e.g. the logistics industry, where incorporating blockchain technology can help improve efficiencies.



Another example is migration of traditional technology infrastructure of existing big companies to a decentralized one.



These are mere examples. My point is, projects targeting such domains and aiming to solve real world problems, are the most probable to get adopted the fastest (adoption is not merely building more wallets, or having crypto stored in phones. That’s just the financial domain, albeit the most resilient one. More on it in the next article).



To add to the point, the lesser the competition to such projects, higher the chances of success.



Another approach is looking into the projects aiming to improve blockchain technology, for e.g. say the projects improving and/or enhancing Ethereum ecosystem, or bring innovation in the blockchain space, for e.g. STO focussed projects.



Discussing further about the real world opportunities/domains where blockchain projects can contribute and add value(numerous) is out of scope of this introductory article.



**Conclusion**



To sum up, the above 3 steps to [fundamental analysis] can greatly help one to analyze the inherent value a project offers.



However, these cover just a basic review of the project. There are more detailed aspects which are crucial to take a measure of a given project, viz. token economics, team finances, community, code review/audit, regulations, whether the token is actually required, what to do if you are from a non-technical background etc.



These topics will be covered in subsequent articles in this series.



Always DYOR!



Hope these ideas help at least some of you.

The crypto community was pleased to find that Bitcoin was able to surge past $6,000 for the first time since the cryptocurrency plunged to its 2018 lows of $3,200 in December.

[**Major collaboration between Bank &amp; Bitcoin system**]

Analysts are now closely watching the $6,400 level to see how the crypto responds to this price, as many analysts believe that there is a significant level of resistance at this price which may lead to a pull back that could offer a good entry point for fresh long positions.

## [ Bank &amp; Bitcoin system] Analysis 

At the time of writing, [**Bitcoin**] is trading up 2.6% at its current price of $6,080, up slightly from its daily lows of $5,900 which were set yesterday.

Over a one-week period, BTC has been able to surge significantly, climbing from lows of $5,500 to highs around its current price levels, marking a major extension of the upwards momentum that the cryptocurrency incurred in early-April when Bitcoin swiftly surged from the low-$4,000 region and into the $5,000 region.

Although the recent series of price surges have been undoubtedly bullish, analysts are still warning traders to express caution before “fomo-ing” into the crypto, as a retrace may be inevitable.

Lucid TA, a popular crypto analyst on Twitter, expressed this sentiment in a recent tweet, noting that traders should closely watch for the next retrace, as it may mark a great entry opportunity for fresh long-positions.",0.031,0.871,0.097,0.946

I had the thought that if an order had a minimum duration of one minute before it could be cancelled, it would greatly reduce this sort of spoofing, as any orders that mattered would have a fair chance of being filled by even a human trader, before they were allowed to be cancelled.

Yesterday, we saw a strong rise in bitcoin price above the $6,200 resistance area against the US Dollar. The BTC/USD pair even broke the $6,350 level and settled well above the 100 hourly simple moving average. 

[**Bitcoin latest News Market crash for this ?**] 

As a result, the bulls are in control and they were successful in clearing a major resistance area near the $6,400 level. Earlier, there was a minor dip, but the $6,280 and $6,300 levels provided support. As a result, the price bounced back and broke the $6,450 level.

It recently tested the $6,500 level and is currently consolidating gains. An initial support is near $6,440, and the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent wave from the $6,245 low to $6,500 high. However, the main support is near the previous breakout zone at $6,400. Besides, the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent wave from the $6,245 low to $6,500 high is also near the $6,400 level to act as a strong support.

____

Since the orthodox bear market low on 06-FEB-2019, the Bitcoin markets have surged to an average 125% gain in approx 100 days approaching mid-MAY. The 3-month rally has now retraced a Fibonacci 23.6% of the entire 2018 bear market. True to form, the bull market has exerted itself in a parabolic rise.

From an Elliott Wave perspective, five waves appear to have completed as follows:

    + Wave-1: 24-FEB
    - Wave-2: 27-FEB
    + Wave-3: 23-APR
    - Wave-4: 25-APR
    + Wave-5: 12-MAY (?)

Given the comparative magnitude and timeframe of the aforementioned waves, the waves are now being considered as MINOR degree. Barring any wave extensions, it appears five MINOR waves have completed, and thus completing the first INTERMEDIATE degree wave of the bull market. A wave of INTERMEDIATE degree usually elapses from weeks to months towards completion.

The expectation now suggests the first notable pullback of the bull market to imminently commence, unfolding in a three wave A-B-C structure. The following are averaged target zones for the pullback, using BITSTAMP prices:

    @5400: approx 50% Fibonacci retracement of 06-FEB to 11-MAY rally (minimum expected decline zone).

    @4888: approx 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of 06-FEB to 11-MAY rally (average expected decline zone).

    @4155: approx 78.6% Fibonacci retracement of 06-FEB to 11-MAY rally (maximum expected decline zone).

The first notable pullback of the 2015-2017 bull market retraced approx 78.6% in size, elapsing approx 6 months until late AUG-2015.

A decline to the 06-FEB low would terminate the proposed wave structure, and quite possibly the bull market.

* BTC: 
* BLX: 

Once the pullback completes, the third and most powerful wave of the 2019+ bull market ought to commence towards the psychological $10,000 level and beyond.

    BITSTAMP Resistance Zones:
    7510, 8500, 9440, 11395, 13350

    BITSTAMP Support Zones:
    7030, 6900, 6410, 5920, 5215, 4320

Since 2016, both the stockmarket and Bitcoin markets have been in synchronisation: both started bull markets in 2016, both had bear markets in 2018, both resumed bull markets in 2019.

Seasonally, the “Sell In May And Go Away” adage is currently being expressed in the stockmarket. 

Since the beginning of May, the Dow Jones has declined 4.50% —the largest decline since the 2019 bull market commenced.

Should the Bitcoin markets decline in MAY, a continued synchronisation may suggest further declines in the stockmarket.

A break below the 25-MAR low of 25,370 in the Dow Jones may suggest further declines, a break below the 11-MAR low of 25,200 would confirm a stockmarket pullback to be underway. If so, an approx 10% decline in the stockmarket towards Dow Jones 24,000 may be expected, followed by resumption of the bull market to new all-time highs. A rise above Dow Jones 26,500 ought to obviate the “Sell In May And Go Away” adage.

05/12/19,"Hi reddit, thanks for readung and helping me!

Im trying to understand exactly how it works but i   cant find better info on the net....

For example, the price is actually 5000$. I think it will go higher and then i buy some BTC at the market price.
Next I put a stop loss in place, in case it goes below 4950$. 
-The stop price is then 4950$, and in case it couldnt sell at that price, I put a limit price of 4900$.

Does that mean that it will try to sell at 4950$, and if it cant, instantly try at 4900$, even if the market price is like 4930$ ? (and then you loose more money than a market price sell?)

I already got fuc.ked up one time with this system, it sold only half of my order and i loss a little bit (I've put 30$ difference between stop and limit price, seems like its not enough....)

I dont see the advantage of this function, why dont install a system which will sell you order as soon as possible when it goes below a certain price??

Let's say you have some BTC deposited on BitMEX and you want to scalp/day trade with it on their platform. So on a daily basis you may make or lose x%. 

Since BTC can have major price swings (such as now where it's doubled it's price within 6 weeks from 4-8k USD), It would affect greatly what your equity is worth when pairing it to a stablecoin or a fiat currency. 

Is it possible to somehow secure the value? I know in a long term trade/investment/commitment you can just hedge a future, but that, for one, just freezes price, per say, and two, isn't dynamic like your equity will be.

I want to imitate what trading FOREX is like, where, even though the underlying currency you have deposited may fluctuate over time, you don't ""feel it"". Fluctuations in FOREX aren't as intense as with BTC, and thus your BitMEX equity literally doubling or halving within weeks.

I used to check the price of cryptocurrency markets multiple times a day. I wished there was a better way but I was unsatisfied with the existing options. So I created [CoinSpy.it] 

It's a simple yet powerful alert engine to notify you about changes in the price and volume of cryptocurrency markets.

You can create rules like:

* Alert me when the BTC/USD price is greater than USD10,000.
* Alert me with the ETH/USD price every 24 hours at 5:00pm.
* Alert me when the XRP/BTC volume increases by 50% in 4 hours.

You can send alerts directly to your phone, email, browser, telegram and more. The app is completely free right now so feel free to use it. I'm also looking for beta testers that want to provide suggestions for improvements and new features.

I use the past match and apply the price changes forward from the current price and plot it on a graph. 



When using a six month pattern the best match lands in Oct 2017 and projects the price will run past $20,000 USD in the next few months and when using a three month pattern it matches at the first 2013 peak and projects a decline to $5K USD before a run 230 days later to $55,000 USD.

05/28/19,"Hello,

I am a breakout trader who frequently uses high leverage to trade. I have never encountered this problem before. Around 5:30 AM GMT, I opened a short position with an average entry of 8994 on the XBTM19 contract. My stop loss was 8999. At 7:05 AM GMT, the price was still on a short term down trend and continuing to make new intraday lows. The highest price on the minute candlestick was 8941 and the lowest being 8881. The bitcoin index was also on a downtrend.

However, I was liquidated at 7:05 AM GMT with 1.8% slippage, at 9039. Without my stops being hit. While the price wick is not even shown anywhere on any chart (price did not visit there). The price went down, and I was liquidated while being short. Thats like being liquidated going long, when the market is going up.

Images of the chart: 

Liquidation: 

Bitmex Response: 

Bitmex said that it is my fault I used high leverage, and that their contracts are based on fair market pricing index. Which is based off the index price. I included a chart of the index price at the time, and there is no wick anywhere. Irony is that they say their fair market price index is to prevent liquidations from happening. This is complete thievery and should be illegal.

Another point: u/rinexc noted that we should be able to see a wick going at least to 9039, since they claimed the liquidation engine closed my order at that price.",0.096,0.867,0.037,-0.9335

The main feature which makes commodities different from other products is that they can be interchangeable with other materials of the same type. That’s why commodities are mined, produced and traded a lot to maintain the global commodity market. 

Commodities can generally be divided into 4 main categories: 

\- **Agricultural** which includes food or industrial crops

\- **Energy**: oil, gas products, electricity

\- **Metals**: gold, diamonds, silver, iron, nickel and etc.

\- **Environmental**: carbon emissions, renewable energy 

**The largest commodity markets**:

1. Chicago Mercantile Exchange (since 1898)

2. Chicago Board of Trade

3. New York Mercantile Exchange

4. Intercontinental Exchange

5. London Metals Exchange 

6. Australian Securities Exchange 

7. Tokyo Commodity Exchange

The main **factors that drives the prices**:

1. Demand

2. Supply

3. US dollar

4. Substitution 

5. Weather (really plays an important role in the commodity prices, e.g. because of natural disasters) 

**Now let’s clear up if cryptocurrency is really commodities.**

Cryptocurrencies are a unique sort of asset and cannot be easily called a currency as the main feature of a currency is a regulation by a government and centralization.

Dear Poloniex Customer,

On May 26, a sudden and severe price crash in the Poloniex CLAM market caused a number of margin loans to default, resulting in a roughly 1800 BTC generalized loss across the Poloniex BTC margin lending pool. We are writing because you have been impacted by this loss.

All BTC loans on Poloniex are lent in a common pool that is shared across all markets and borrowers. Today, we recognized the generalized loss across lenders in the BTC margin lending pool. As a result, the principal of all active BTC loans as of 14:00 UTC today has been reduced by 16.202%. As a lender in the pool, you will see the reduction in your account when you next log in.

We’re actively pursuing the defaulted borrowers for repayment of the BTC they owe to the lending pool. As we recover funds, we will return them to affected lenders. We’re also exploring other ways to help defray your losses. As this work proceeds, we will provide regular updates.

To learn more about this event, please refer to this blog post.

If you have specific questions about your account please contact our customer support team at support@poloniex.freshdesk.com.

06/15/19,"Wrote this in a comment reply but I feel like it warrants its own post and discussion: 

Here's the problem:

The difference between the liquidation price and bankruptcy price gets bigger and bigger as the maintenance margin rises from the initial 0.5% up 0.5% every 100 BTC in additional position size on perps and every 50 BTC in additional position size on futures.

If you are trading large positions on high leverage, your maintenance margin can go up to 8% (largest it ever was for me, but if I had done bigger size it would have been higher). This means your liquidation price is a solid **8%** higher/lower (depending on whether you are long/short). So if you are on 10x leverage, normally price would need to move 9.5 percent to liquidate you, but now it only has to move **2%**, 10x leverage effectively becomes **50x** leverage because of the ridiculous increases in maintenance margin. Thus, the larger positions are getting liquidated easiest, quickly increasing the size of the insurance fund because 8% is taken.


In order to feasibly trade larger positions of over 1000 BTC in total size, one is only able to use very low leverage - usually under 5x in order to get semi-reasonable liquidations prices, which won't get triggered by a single digit percentage swing. And when you get liquidated, you are always still getting massively scammed whatever your leverage is, because you are getting liquidted - EVEN THOUGH YOU HAVE ENOUGH MARGIN ALLOCATED TO THE POSITION TO SUPPORT ANOTHER 8% price movement against you (in my case). The margin requirement pre-supposes that my liquidation won't get filled within the bankruptcy price - this is not supported by the past 1 year of trading, in which volumes have increased and auto deleveraging has gone almost extinct.

This structure made sense in the early days - when bitmex had low volume and auto deleveraging was consant (liquidations were not getting filled between the liquidation price and bankruptcy price, they were getting filled lower in case of longs and above in case of shorts) because of lack of volume.

Today, their volume is huge and auto deleveraging almost never happens because liquidations are getting filled quickly, due to more users and more volume. The maintenance margin requirements have, however, remained the same for the past 3 years. IN FACT, in the case of futures, they have gotten worse, as they used to be the same as perps - 0.5% increase every 100 BTC, not every 50 BTC as is the case now. This is DESPITE massive increase in volume on futures!.

Conclusion:

Maintenance margins are EXCESSIVELY HIGH

Excessively high, progressive maintenance margin means that large traders are getting massively FUCKED. Their positions get liquidated EXTREMELY PREMATURELY, because of the insane increases in required margin.

Those liquidations get easily filled because the volume is high

Required margins are put into insurance fund, which never gets used up because the volume is so high it unecessary.

MY OPINION: This is PURE THEFT by Bitmex. PURE THEFT.

EDIT: Also, the insurance fund doesn't protect you from losses - it prevents deleveraging which might cause you to realize less profit than you would have if you closed when you wanted. The purpose of deleveraging is to protect bitmex from losses - they dont cover out of pocket when a liquidation doesnt get filled within its bankruptcy price. Thus, the insurance fund is to alleviate pain to the user from possible deleveraging - which results from the LEGITIMATE AND NECESSARY need of Bitmex to protect themselves from liability. HOWEVER, the current environment of high volume on bitmex means that autodeleveraging is almost never necessary - yet the insurance fund is getting grossly full because the margin requirements are SET UP IN AN ENVIRONMENT OF LOW VOLUME AND FREQUENT DELEVERAGING when the exchange opened.

EDIT 2: Don't get me wrong, I love Bitmex, I think its the best futures exchange and the most secure, best and most reliable payouts, its great, I use it, I love it.

The 2019 Bitcoin bull market which began from the lows of 06-FEB-2019, has now retraced a Fibonacci 38.2% of the entire 2018 bear market, thus far into JUN-2019.

The largest pullback of this bull market occurred from 14-MAY to 17-MAY, where a mini flash crash saw a rapid sell-off of up to 25% declines on multiple exchanges, notably pronounced on BITSTAMP and BITMEX. Afterwards, from mid-MAY to mid-JUN, price action produced a choppy sideways affair elapsing a month with no clear direction.

Consequently, it was expected the first wave of the bull market had completed, and the first notable pullback of the bull market was imminently underway, correlating with the “Sell In May And Go Away” adage which gripped the stockmarket. This has proved to be incorrect. The month of choppy sideways price action has resolved with a breakout to the upside, necessitating a revision to the Elliott Wave model…

* BTC: 

The characteristics of the 2019 bull market thus far, can be summarised by the following revised Elliott Wave model: 

    + Wave-1 (06-FEB — 23-APR): subdivided into smaller degree impulsive waves.
    - Wave-2 (23-APR — 25-APR): a simple Zig Zag correction.
    + Wave-3 (25-APR — 14-MAY): a parabolic rise.
    - Wave-4 (14-MAY — 09-JUN): a complex Running Flat correction.
    + Wave-5 (09-JUN —      ?): a parabolic rise?

The final and fifth wave of the waveset appears to be underway since 09-JUN. The following price zones speculate where this may terminate; using BITSTAMP prices:

    @9440:  Fibonacci 38.2% retracement of the entire 2018 bear market.
    @11390: Fibonacci 50.0% retracement of the entire 2018 bear market.
    @13340: Fibonacci 61.8% retracement of the entire 2018 bear market.

The first aforementioned Fibonacci zone has already been reached; hence, there is a possibility to suggest the uptrend has either completed, or is nearing completion. 

The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) passively tracks the price of Bitcoin, but trades on the OTC markets from Mon to Fri during the hours of US equity markets. The reduced price action of a non-continuous contract may offer clarity with parabolic waves; at this point in time a drop to 10.8 is required to suggest the uptrend is complete…

* GBTC: 

Once the uptrend concludes, it completes the first notable advance of the 2019 Bitcoin bull market. At which point, a Fibonacci 61.8% retracement may be expected for the first notable pullback of the 2019 Bitcoin bull market; perhaps commencing in the week of the Solstice and elapsing a couple of months over the summer lull. Afterwards, the bull market is expected to parabolically reignite by the early autumn and head towards new all-time highs in 2020. 

The long-term overall Elliott Wave model suggests four PRIMARY degree waves completed from mid-2010 to early-2019, and the fifth advancing wave is currently underway. Waves of PRIMARY degree elapse from a few months to a couple of years.

A common wave relationship guides the price of the fifth wave to be equal to, or extend a Fibonacci 1.618 times, the length from the low of the first wave through to the high of third wave, projected from the low of the fourth wave. This provides a conservative target of the current bull market to conclude between $22912 and $35127, calculated using the BraveNewCoin (BNC:BLX) index…

    @22912: PRIMARY[5] = (PRIMARY[1] + PRIMARY[3]) * 1
    @35127: PRIMARY[5] = (PRIMARY[1] + PRIMARY[3]) * 1.618

Adjusted and renewed targets can be expected in the event of subdividing and extending waves.

06/18/19,"According to an analyst from the CoinDesk Team Omkar Godbole, soon the price of the first cryptocurrency will reach the barrier around $10000.

Omar Godbole cited a number of factors contributing to the growth of BTC. The first of them is the upcoming launch of the cryptocurrency project GlobalCoin from Facebook. The initiative was supported by financially prominent investors, including the notorious head of the Digital Currency Group Barry Silbert.

The next growth factor may be the transfer of capital from BNB to BTC due to restrictions on the platform [Binance.com] In particular, this scenario does not exclude cryptanalyst Alex Kruger.

Over the past seven days, bitcoin has grown by 17.5%, finally rising above the important $8000 mark.

We will remind, recently Barry Silbert declared that notorious ""crypto winter"" is in the past.

In this article, we will try to remember all the major theft of cryptocurrencies over the past 10 years.

**1. Bitstamp $5.3 mln (BTC), January 4th, 2015**

On January 4, 2015, the operational hot wallet of Bitstamp announced that it was hacked by an anonymous hacker and 19,000 Bitcoins (worth of $5 million) were lost.

The initiation of the attack fell on November 4, 2014. Then Damian Merlak, the CTO of the exchange, was offered free tickets to punk rock festival Punk Rock Holiday 2015 via Skype, knowing that Merlak is interested in such music and he plays in the band. To receive the tickets, he was asked to fill out a participant questionnaire by sending a file named “Punk Rock Holiday 2015 TICKET Form1.doc”. This file contained the VBA script. By opening the file, he downloaded the malware on his computer. Although Merlak did not suspect wrong and has opened the ""application form"", to any critical consequences, this did not open access to the funds of exchange.

The attackers, however, did not give up. The attack continued for five weeks, during which hackers presented themselves as journalists, then headhunters.

Finally, the attackers were lucky. On December 11, 2014, the infected word document was opened on his machine by Bitstamp system administrator Luka Kodric, who had access to the exchange wallet. The file came to the victim by email, allegedly on behalf of an employee of the Association for computer science, although in fact, as the investigation showed, the traces of the file lead deep into Tor. Hackers were not limited to just one letter. Skype attacker pretending to be an employee of the Association for computing machinery, convinced that his Frame though to make international honor society, which required some paperwork. Kodric believed.

By installing a Trojan on Kodriс's computer hackers were able to obtain direct access to the hot wallet of the exchange. The logs show that the attacker, under the account of Kodric, gained access to the server LNXSRVBTC, where he kept the wallet file.dat, and the DORNATA server where the password was stored. Then the servers were redirected to a certain IP address that belongs to one of the providers of Germany.

There are still no official reports of arrests in this case. Obviously, the case is complicated by the fact that the hackers are outside the UK, and the investigation has to cooperate with law enforcement agencies in other countries.

**2. GateHub $9.5 mln (XRP), June 1th, 2019**

Hackers have compromised nearly 100 XRP Ledger wallets on cryptocurrency wallet service GateHub. The incident was reported by GateHub in a preliminary statement on June 6.

XRP enthusiast Thomas Silkjær, who first noticed the suspicious activity, estimates that the hackers have stolen nearly $10 million worth of cryptocurrency (23,200,000 XRP), $5.5 million (13,100,000 XRP) of which has already been laundered through exchanges and mixer services.

GateHub notes that it is still conducting an investigation and therefore cannot publish any official findings. Also, GateHub advises victims to make complaints to the relevant authorities of their jurisdiction.

**3. Tether, $30.9 mln (USDT), November 19th, 2017**

Tether created a digital currency called ""US tokens"" (USDT) — they could be used to trade real goods using Bitcoin, Litecoin and Ether. By depositing $1 in Tether, the user received 1 USD, which can be converted back into fiat. On November 19, 2017, the attacker gained access to the main Tether wallet and withdrew $ 30.9 million in tokens. For the transaction, he used a Bitcoin address, which means that it was irreversible.

To fix the situation, Tether took action by which the hacker was unable to withdraw the stolen money to fiat or Bitcoin, but the panic led to a decrease in the value of Bitcoin.

**4. Ethereum, $31 mln (ETH), July 20th, 2017**

On July 20, 2017, the hacker transferred 153,037 Ethers to $31 million from three very large wallets owned by SwarmCity, Edgeless Casino and Eternity. Unknown fraudster managed to change the ownership of wallets, taking advantage of the vulnerability with multiple signatures.

First, the theft was noticed by the developers of SwarmCity.

Further events deserve a place in history: ""white hackers"" returned the stolen funds, and then protected other compromised accounts. They acted in the same way as criminals, who stole funds from vulnerable wallets — just not for themselves. And it all happened in less than a day.

**5. Dao (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) $70 mln (ETH), June 18th, 2016**

On June 18, 2016, members of the Ethereum community noticed that funds were being drained from the DAO and the overall ETH balance of the smart contract was going down. A total of 3.6 million Ether (worth around $70 million at the time) was drained by the hacker in the first few hours. The attack was possible because of an exploit found in the splitting function. The attacker/s withdrew Ether from the DAO smart contract multiple times using the same DAO Tokens. This was possible due to what is known as a recursive call exploit. 

In this exploit, the attacker was able to ""ask"" the smart contract (DAO) to give the Ether back multiple times before the smart contract could update its own balance. There were two main faults that made this possible: the fact that when the DAO smart contract was created the coders did not take into account the possibility of a recursive call, and the fact that the smart contract first sent the ETH funds and then updated the internal token balance.

It's important to understand that this bug did not come from Ethereum itself, but from this one application that was built on Ethereum. The code written for the DAO had multiple bugs, and the recursive call exploit was one of them. Another way to look at this situation is to compare Ethereum to the Internet and any application based on Ethereum to a website: if a website is not working, it doesn't mean that the Internet is not working, it simply means that one website has a problem.

The hacker stopped draining the DAO for unknown reasons, even though they could have continued to do so.

The Ethereum community and team quickly took control of the situation and presented multiple proposals to deal with the exploit. In order to prevent the hacker from cashing in the Ether from his child DAO after the standard 28 days, a soft-fork was voted on and came very close to being introduced. A few hours before it was set to be released, a few members of the community found a bug with the implementation that opened a denial-of-service attack vector. This soft fork was designed to blacklist all the transactions made from the DAO.

**6. NiceHash, 4736.42 (BTC), December 6th, 2017**

NiceHash is a Slovenian cryptocurrency hash power broker with integrated marketplace that connects sellers of hashing power (miners) with buyers of hashing power using the sharing economy approach.

On December 6, 2017, the company's servers became the target of attack. At first, Reddit users reported that they could not access their funds and make transactions — when they tried to log in, they were shown a message about a service interruption. In the end, it became known that the service had undergone a major cyberattack and 4736,42 Bitcoins disappeared without a trace.

Despite heavy losses, NiceHash was able to continue working, but CEO and founder Marco Koval resigned, giving way to a new team. The company managed to maintain the trust of investors and began to strengthen the protection of its systems.

**7. Mt.Gox, 850000 (BTC), June 19th, 2011**

The Hacking Of Mt.Gox was one of the biggest Bitcoin thefts in history. It was the work of highly professional hackers using complex vulnerabilities.

A hacker (or a group of hackers) allegedly gained access to a computer owned by one of the auditors and used a security vulnerability to access Mt.Gox servers, then changed the nominal value of Bitcoin to 1 cent per coin.

Then they brought out about 2000 BTC. Some customers, without knowing it, conducted transactions at this low price, a total of 650 BTC, and despite the fact that the hacking hit the headlines around the world, no Bitcoin could be returned.

To increase investor confidence, the company has compensated all of the stolen coins, placed most of the remaining funds in offline storage, and the next couple of years was considered the most reliable Bitcoin exchanger in the world.

However, it was only an illusion of reliability.

The problems of the organization were much more serious, and the management probably did not even know about them.

CEO of Mt.Gox, Mark Karpeles, was originally a developer, but over time he stopped delving into technical details, basking in the rays of glory — because he created the world's largest platform for cryptocurrency exchange. At that time Mt.Gox handled over 70% of all Bitcoin transactions.

And, of course, there were those who wanted to take advantage of the technological weakness of the service. At some point, hackers made it so that Bitcoins could be bought at any price, and within minutes millions of dollars worth of coins were sold — mostly for pennies. World prices for Bitcoin stabilized in a few minutes, but it was too late.

As a result, Mt.Gox lost about 850,000 Bitcoins. The exchange had to declare bankruptcy, hundreds of thousands of people lost money, and the Japanese authorities arrested CEO Mark Karpeles for fraud. He pleaded not guilty and was subsequently released. In 2014, the authorities restored some of the Bitcoins remaining at the old addresses, but did not transfer them to the exchange, and created a trust to compensate for the losses of creditors.

**8. Coincheck, $530 mln, January 26th, 2018**

The sum was astonishing, and even surpassed the infamous Mt.Gox hack.

While Mt.Gox shortly filed for bankruptcy following the hack, Coincheck has surprisingly remained in business and was even recently approved as a licensed exchange by Japan’s Financial Services (FSA).

Coincheck was founded in 2014 in Japan and was one of the most popular cryptocurrency exchanges in the country. Offering a wide variety of digital assets including Bitcoin, Ether, LISK, and NEM, Coincheck was an emerging exchange that joined the Japan Blockchain Association.

Since Coincheck was founded it 2014, it was incidentally not subject to new exchange registration requirements with Japan’s FSA — who rolled out a framework after Mt. Gox –, and eventually was a contributing factor to its poor security standards that led to the hack.

On January 26th, 2018, Coincheck posted on their blog detailing that they were restricting NEM deposits and withdrawals, along with most other methods for buying or selling cryptocurrencies on the platform. Speculation arose that the exchange had been hacked, and the NEM developers issued a statement saying they were unaware of any technical glitches in the NEM protocol and any issues were a result of the exchange’s security.

Coincheck subsequently held a high-profile conference where they confirmed that hackers had absconded with 500 million NEM tokens that were then distributed to 19 different addresses on the network. Totaling roughly $530 million at the time — NEM was hovering around $1 then — the Coincheck hack was considered the largest theft in the industry’s history.

Coincheck was compelled to reveal some embarrassing details about their exchange’s security, mentioning how they stored all of the NEM in a single hot wallet and did not use the NEM multisignature contract security recommended by the developers.

Simultaneously, the NEM developers team had tagged all of the NEM stolen in the hack with a message identifying the funds as stolen so that other exchanges would not accept them. However, NEM announced they were ending their hunt for the stolen NEM for unspecified reasons several months later, and speculation persisted that hackers were close to cashing out the stolen funds on the dark web.

Mainstream media covered the hack extensively and compared it to similar failures by cryptocurrency exchanges in the past to meet adequate security standards. At the time, most media coverage of cryptocurrencies was centered on their obscure nature, dramatic volatility, and lack of security. Coincheck’s hack fueled that narrative considerably as the stolen sum was eye-popping and the cryptocurrency used — NEM — was unknown to most in the mainstream.

NEM depreciated rapidly following the hack, and the price fell even more throughout 2018, in line with the extended bear market in the broader industry. Currently, NEM is trading at approximately $0.07, a precipitous fall from ATH over $1.60 in early January.

The extent of the Coincheck hack was rivaled by only a few other hacks, notably the Mt.Gox hack. While nominally Coincheck is the largest hack in the industry’s history, the effects of Mt.Gox were significantly more impactful since the stolen funds consisted only of Bitcoin and caused a sustained market correction as well as an ongoing controversy with the stolen funds and founder. Moreover, Mt.Gox squandered 6% of the overall Bitcoin circulation at the time in a market that was much less mature than it is today.

Despite the fallout, Coincheck is now fully operational and registered with Japan’s FSA.

06/24/19,"In order to increase the security level of your funds, you can use wallets. They have a higher level of protection in comparison with the exchanges. In this article, you will get to know about the advantages and disadvantages of wallets, get acquainted with their varieties and the most popular examples.

#### What is a digital wallet?

A **digital wallet** is a place to store your public and private keys. It consists of a private key and a public key (in our previous article you can learn more about what private and public keys are).

#### Hot and cold wallet

**Cold wallets** are a way to store funds offline. These include any tools that are not tied to the network**.** Cold storage eliminates the interaction of the wallet and the online network, which significantly reduces the likelihood of theft.

*Advantages:*  
Higher security.  
The possibility of offline storage.

*Disadvantages:*  
Poorly adapted for regular payments.  
May be lost with the carrier.  
Require backup.

**Hot wallets** are programs designed to store digital coins with a constant Internet connection which allows you to send cryptocurrencies anywhere.

*Advantages:*  
Great for regular and micropayments.  
Convenient and easy to use.  
Do not require physical media.

*Disadvantages:*  
Can be hacked.  
Always connected to the Internet.  
If you uninstall the program, you may lose access to your wallet forever.

#### Types of wallets

There are five types of digital storage that you can use**.**

**1. Online Wallet**  
This is a service owned by a third party. Depending on the wallet device, the keys are stored on a remote server or downloaded as an encrypted file to the user’s computer. They allow not only to open several wallets for different cryptocurrencies, but also to carry out convertible operations, trade on exchanges, calculate commissions with the help of built-in calculators, etc.

*Advantages:*  
Quick registration.  
Anonymity. Verification is not necessary.  
Ability to work with multiple cryptocurrencies.

*Disadvantages:*  
Risks inherent in cryptocurrency exchanges. There is a possibility of wallet to be hacked.  
Additional expenditure.

There are no reliable ways to protect funds on such platforms. Therefore, recommendations for the protection of funds are reduced to the diversification of risks, that is, working simultaneously with several wallets.

***Examples of popular online wallets:***  
**HolyTransaction**. The multi-currency wallet, founded in 2014, supports more than 10 of the most popular cryptocurrencies. It has an intuitive interface, Commission in comparison with other wallets.  
**Coinbase**. The wallet, created in 2012, supports bitcoin and ether.  
**Cryprtonator**. The most popular multi-currency wallet in the CIS.

**2. Mobile Wallet**  
This is a program to install on mobile gadgets. Interesting for those for whom cryptocurrency is a means of payment for goods and services. The current version of the blockchain is usually stored on the application server that provides access to updated data and does not require a large download of data to the phone.

*Advantages:*  
It can be safer than online wallets. Conveniently use on the go. Offer additional features such as QR code scanning.

*Disadvantages:*  
Unfortunately, mobile wallets are not the most secure. Therefore, it is hardly suitable for storing large amounts of funds.

***Examples of popular mobile wallets:***  
**Coinomi**. One of the best wallets for Android that supports more than 50 cryptocurrencies. Its advantage is the ability to enter seed-phrase, which allows you to recover wallet data.  
**Xapo**. Wallet from California company that supports Bitcoin. Access to the funds in the wallet is insured, it is possible to issue a debit card, you need to bind a mobile number.

**3. Hardware wallet**

This is a separate removable device like a flash drive. This method of storing keys is not very popular yet, because it is suitable only for long-term storage (it is inconvenient to trade with it). But it does not overload the computer.

*Advantages:*  
Private keys are never exposed to your computer. The hardware is immune to computer viruses.  
Your hardware requires you to confirm a transaction on your device (not the app on your computer) before any coins can be spent.

*Disadvantages:*  
The only downside to hardware wallets is that they cost money. However, it might be worthwhile to consider investing in a hardware wallet because they are more secure; especially if you hold a significant amount of coins.

***Examples of popular hardware wallets:***  
**KeepKay**. Supports 4 major cryptocurrencies.  
**Ledger Wallet**.  
**Trezor**.

**4. Desktop wallet**

These are the programs that you install on your computer.

*Advantages:*  
Desktop wallets store keys on your hard drive. Considered that its one of the most reliable options among offline wallets. It is a program installed on your computer, with which you can access data about your cryptocurrency account.

*Disadvantages:*  
Their disadvantage is the need for constant updating, which takes a lot of memory. Because desktop programs are divided into “thick” and “thin”. “Thick” (“heavy”) program, who are themselves from the very beginning, download whole blockchain and keep them updated. “Thin” (“light”) — download the necessary information from third-party services. Despite the fact that the file with the key remains on the computer, there is a risk that the data from the services will not be downloaded the ones that are needed.

***Examples of popular mobile wallets:***  
**Exodus**. Has an integrated exchange platform ShareShift supports 7 cryptocurrencies.  
**Bitcoin Core**. One of the best wallets for bitcoin, working with all operating systems.  
**Armory**. In addition to Bitcoin Core, which allows you to increase the level of storage security.

**5. Paper wallet**

A unique option for storing keys, which is a printout of a picture with a QR-code containing a public address and a private key. Long-term storage option for those who do not trust electronics.

***Example:***  
**bitaddress.org**

Imagine that I had good entry points for long x3 and I'm now 100% into the position, no avaiable balance. I have no BTC left to keep increasing the position and I want Bitmex to give me back the margin I used, so I can buy more.

As I'm x3 my entry price and liquidation is so far away that I'm considering it safe. I want to go x5 or x10, so what happens when I increase the leverage bar?

1) Do my number of contracts and entry price stay the same? So my real profit stay the same even that ROE shows something different?

2) My liquidation comes closer to entry price as if I had used x10 from the beggining? It can be considered safu at this point as long as entry price doesn't change.

3) How much margin do I receive? I used a lot of BTC to buy contracts when the price was low. Will Bitmex just give it back ignoring price increase?

That's it guys. I came to ask here because Bitmex sub sucks and also it can be a trading strategy to use low leverage in the beggining and increase it later when risk is under control.

06/27/19,"Imagine if you could pay for ""insurance"" either on the upside or downside of bitcoin, so for example, if the price moons, you can cash in, but if it tanks, you only lose what you paid for the insurance.

This is effectively the idea behind Options, a financial 'derivative', and have been available in stocks for ages. 

&amp;nbsp;

**How Options Work**

You can probably google much better resources to explain options, but the quick run down is you choose a ""strike price"" which is the price of the 'underlying' the particular option you buy will be based around. You can buy either a 'call' (betting the stock will go up) or a put (betting the stock will go down). You pay a 'premium' (same idea with insurance) for the privilege of this contract. 

*Call Option Example:*

Right now Bitcoin is at around ~$11,000. Let's say you do not own any bitcoin, but you think there's a high chance of bitcoin will go up hugely in the next week, but are also worried about a crash because you can't predict the future. You could buy a call option with a strike price of say ~$13,000. Technically, this gives you the right to buy 1 bitcoin (or whatever amount the contract spec says) at $13,000. You don't have to ""exercise"" the contract and actually collect the bitcoin (assuming it's not already cash settled), you can just resell the option contract, but we'll get to that. There will also be an expiration date, just like insurance, let's say a week.

Let's say the price goes to $15,000 before expiration. Because your contract gives you the right to buy 1 bitcoin at $13,000, your contract is effectively worth $2,000. Therefore, your profit at that time would be $2,000 minus the premium you paid. When the price of the underlying passes the strike price this is called being ""in the money"".

Now let's say the price tanks to $9000. If you had bought an actual bitcoin at $11k, you would would be down $2K. After buying an option, your option will remain ""out of the money"", and if it expires, your maximum loss is what premium you paid. However, until expiration, your option still has value because of the 'chance' the underlying price will go up. Therefore you can even sell your option at any time before expiration and not lose the whole premium. This is called ""time value"" and decreases the closer to expiration. (Note that the closer to expiration, and further from the strike price, the less it will be worth).

*Put Option Example:*

Put options are the just the reverse, where you bet the price will go down instead of up. It gives you the right to sell 1 bitcoin at the strike price. So if the price of bitcoin goes below the strike price, it lets you sell a bitcoin at a price higher than the actual price. So it is like insurance on a price dump. Again, even if you don't own a bitcoin to sell, you can sell the contract before expiration for profit, or if it's cash settled, the exchange just gives you the profit in funds at expiration, if applicable. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Wow this sounds great, what are the risks?**

Depending on how you use them, options can either increase or lower your risk. They must be used with care, because they not only require you to be correct directionally, but also the time-wise, and price-wise. Meaning if the price goes past the strike price after expiration, too bad. Also, if you are wrong in the direction of the price, you should assume you will lose the entire premium, which for bitcoin is not cheap. Deribit is the only exchange I know of that has options, but there is another company called LedgerX that just got approval in the USA and will apparently launch soon. 

Further, you have to carefully consider which strike price and expiration, because the premiums will be very different. For example, right now on Deribit, a 1-week option contract ""At the money"" (meaning right next to the actual price, so much more likely to go in the money if you are directionally correct) costs about $700. A contract with a strike price $2000 (~$13k) away from the current price costs about $400. A 1-month contract with a strike $2000 away costs over $1000. So you more pay for the longer time frame, and for a closer strike price. By the way, the prices are determined by the market, by buyers and sellers bidding, just like the underlying, just in a different way. (Yes, you can SELL options and get a premium, like selling insurance, but that's a whole different can of worms I won't get into). One consequence of this is because Deribit is not very liquid, there are big spreads on the contracts. 

&amp;nbsp;

**How to use options (personal opinion)**

I think options are best used in times of great uncertainty. Like that huge run up the other day. If you want to HODL but think there is a good chance bitcoin will crash in the short term, you could buy a put option to hedge against a drop and effectively ""cancel it out"". Or during a big dip like right now because I honestly am uncertain whether it will recover, so I sold my bitcoin position but bought call options. The options were not cheap but I'd rather reduce my upside by a bit in exchange for defining my downside.

So in my case, if bitcoin does skyrocket in the next week/month (I bought 2 time frames), I will miss out on the profit from the range between the current price and the strike prices, but my upside is still unlimited. But if it tanks further, I am absolutely limited on the downside.

Obviously another advantage of options is the leverage. You can effectively control much more bitcoin without having to use the full capital, but rather just the cost of the premium.",0.081,0.811,0.108,0.9928

If Bitcoin can recover here it could only be the beginning of a similar bullish trend; however if it can't, the bearish pressure from 2018 might take over once again to create a long period of sideways movement or a retest of lows.

In my last post, I showed why my confidence in there being more than one more bubble is too low to justify remaining heavily invested in cryptocurrencies. In this article I want to expand upon that reasoning by talking a little bit about human factors that lead me to believe that stablecoins pose a great risk to traditional cryptocurrencies.

**Defining CML**

People differ in a number of ways, and they express all sorts of personality traits. However, in my interactions with people in all areas of life, I've noticed that one characteristic seems to differentiate people more than any other. I'll refer to this characteristic as ""CML"" throughout the rest of this post, as the best way I was able to describe it is a sequence of curiosity, motivation, and logic. People who exhibit this trait use those three steps to evaluate and act when faced with most situations, while people who do not exhibit this trait fail to do so. An overwhelming majority of people do not possess the ""CML"" trait and its absence increasingly hinders their abilities to understand and succeed in the world as technology and social structures become increasingly complex.

Here are a few examples of common scenarios people face in life.

* **At lunch, a co-worker discusses a movie that he's seen and talks about some aspect of it that he really enjoyed.** A high-CML person might search for the movie on Google to read a synopsis of it, or will watch the movie himself to learn more. Low-CML people will nod and politely respond to what the other person is saying, then give it no further thought.
* **An error message appears in an application a person uses often.** A high-CML person might search for or ask someone for information about the error message to get at least a cursory understanding of what the problem could be, or to figure out the best way to avoid it without understanding it. A low-CML person will often state ""I didn't go to college, so I can't understand this"" or ""it's beyond my capabilities"" and will believe the error is unsolvable.
* **A person just got laid off from a job.** A high-CML person might create a spreadsheet listing his options, which in addition to finding a new job would include different possibilities like traveling on savings, working less and cutting back on expenses, or starting a business. A low-CML person would likely start firing off resumes to companies immediately without considering all the options first, because that's what society told him to do.
* **A person is asked to go skydiving.** A high-CML person would say ""yes,"" or would ask questions about skydiving before declining, because high-CML people evaluate risks and try new experiences. A low-CML person would decline immediately because skydiving is perceived as dangerous and that's not what he does.
* **A person buys a new gadget.** A high-CML person sets up the gadget so that it is configured correctly for their home. A low-CML person turns on the gadget without looking to see if there is an easier way to do it, and then wastes hours over the years performing complex routines over and over again to work around whatever is wrong for them with the default configuration.

When presented with new information or with a decision, high-CML people are **curious** about how things work. They are **motivated** to learn more about the topic. They use **logic** to think through why things are they way they are, and arrive at a logical conclusion based upon the new knowledge they gained by being curious and motivated. In contrast, when low-CML people are presented with new information or a decision, they lack the curiosity and motivation to improve their knowledge, and often do what is most common in society.

You can tell that a person is low-CML if he says phrases like ""that's dumb,"" ""you're weird,"" or ""because I don't like it."" The response in some forums where I reposted the last post about bubbles and the singularity was met by many low-CML people stating it was ""insane"" or ""delusional."" High-CML people but who disapprove of something would instead say ""that point is wrong because..."" The first phrases demonstrate a lack of thought about the topic, while the last shows that the person spent some time considering the topic, even though they both come to the same conclusion. You can probably picture several people you know who are low-CML, and may know someone who is high-CML.

CML is not related to intelligence, and low-CML people are not dumb. While there are some people who unfortunately have severe disabilities and will never be able to understand most topics, 99% of people can gain enough knowledge of almost any topic to make good decisions if they are willing to spend a little energy on learning about it. Even complex topics, like computer programming, are within reach of most people. While learning how to avoid race conditions in Javascript is a challenge, it's not difficult to understand the difference between a client and a server, how a single core processor differs from a quad-core processor, or that a computer consists of memory and a CPU and a hard drive.  Consider how many people spend 12 hours a day looking at their phone screens, but have never bothered to understand what the purpose of  graphics processor is.

Low-CML people innately believe that they do not have the ability to learn or think logically. Therefore, they take the easiest way out on almost everything, even though that repeatedly leads to suboptimal outcomes for them. They make the same mistakes over and over, despite the fact that there is almost always a way to put in 5% more effort to get out something that is 50% better.

**The world's problems**

As technology continues to advance at an ever increasing pace, CML is becoming the core trait that divides humanity. Increasingly, people are becoming divided into two camps - those who understand the basics of how computers work, and those who do not. And the difference between people who understand the basics is not intelligence, education, or age, but whether a person is low-CML or high-CML.

At the core of most of the political issues of today is a battle between low-CML people who believe they are powerless against technological change, and high-CML people who take the time to understand these changes. Trump, Johnson, and (to a lesser extent so far) Le Pen have been effective at rallying people who do not exhibit the curiosity to learn about why the world is the way it is. Their opponents are people who have put careful thought into the issues and come to a reasoned belief.

Unfortunately, the number of people who are motivated to learn new information and remain informed in the world is far lower than the number of people who never examine the reasons why anything is true. One of the reasons why fake news is so prevalent and effective is apparently because many people share articles after having only read the headline. The politicians above recognize this low motivation to read the article and create false soundbytes that they know low-CML people will not take the time to fact-check.

An enormous amount of effort is now being spent on making products inferior to what they used to be to cater to low-CML people. For example, when Windows boots, in 1995 there used to be a list of the drivers being loaded. Then, in 2005 there was a progress bar. Now, there's a spinning or pulsing Windows logo with no information indicating what is happening at all. Even though these changes didn't affect the stability of Windows or the load time in any way, Microsoft hid useful information, probably because a marketing department found that low-CML people had a negative reaction to seeing code they said was ""nerdy"" or ""weird.""

**How CML relates to cryptocurrencies**

Now that you're aware of what CML is, it should be easy to explain why I believe that stablecoins are the first real threat to cryptocurrency.

In a recent conversation, I discussed Purse.io with someone. I had mentioned that my Purse orders were being regularly filled at 33% discounts, and that I had saved about $3000 during the past year by using Purse. I asked why he hadn't used Purse, given that he earned much less than I did and that $3000 to him would be life changing. His response was immediate and typical of a low-CML person: because bitcoins have too much volatility. I explained to him that volatility isn't a factor because you can buy the amount of bitcoin cash you need, send it to Purse, and spend it immediately, all within 10 minutes. The next response was that there were crashes in cryptocurrencies, so I pointed out that while that crashes did occur, it is extremely rare, if ever, that the price of bitcoin cash fell by 33% in 10 minutes - so even if there were a crash, you could still save money.

In the end, that person never did sign up for Purse - and that should be a huge warning flag to everyone. Purse is as close to a ""killer app"" for cryptocurrency as there ever will be. On bulk trash collection weekends near where I live, there are huge pickup trucks owned by people who supplement their income by driving hundreds of miles around the neighborhoods picking up metal to sell it at a few cents per pound to a scrapyard, costing hundreds of dollars in gas and maintenance to scrape out a miniscule profit. These same people could sign up for Purse and order necessities, like toothpaste and soap, saving more money in an hour than the few bucks they can make (and that's before taxes) in an entire night picking up trash, simply because they think Purse is too complicated.

The enormous discounts on Purse - the maximum of 33% - remain. In any efficient market, one would expect these discounts to decline to be close to what one can achieve by gaming the credit card system, where one can get 5% cash back on Amazon with some cards. The belief that cryptocurrency is too complicated and volatile is so anathema to low-CML people that they are willing to ignore thousands of dollars in savings because they aren't willing to try it and form their own opinions.

**Why stablecoins will become dominant**

Stablecoins are the exact type of product that appeals to low-CML people, because they are exactly the same thing as government-backed money is. They are just backed by corporations instead. Science fiction has, for 50 years, been predicting what is happening with stablecoins, where eventually corporations gain so much power that they buy entire planets and mine them for minerals. The only difference these authors failed to predict is that instead of employees of the huge corporations spending company scrip, they will be spending cryptocurrencies created by the companies. These stablecoins can be backed by more than one asset across a wide range of classes, such as gold, bitcoins, real estate, and other things, to prevent inflation or deflation better than today's currencies do.

One of the reasons why stablecoins will become dominant is that low-CML people aren't willing to question what money is backed by, as many cryptocurrency enthusiasts do, or learn about economics. They won't care that their money is backed by facebook instead of the United States. As long as it appears to be worth the same amount, that will be fine with them. They won't look into whether facebook actually is in good financial condition to back that promise, just as many people share headlines without even a cursory glance to see whether they have any possibility of being true.

Unbacked cryptocurrencies have turned into a circus. After an entire decade, they still aren't used for everyday purchases, and the volatility in the past week has been more ridiculous than ever. Low-CML people are not motivated to spend a few minutes learning about why these coins are valuable and useful. If they had been motivated, these markets wouldn't be in the absurd state they are in now.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, I've had to change my outlook from years ago after realizing that stablecoins are likely to suck up most of the world's money over the next ten years. Unlike bitcoin, they are run by corporations that can make a profit by advertising the coins and getting people to use them. Low-CML people, who are the majority of people in society, follow what they are told without being willing to understand why they are told it. As the incredible Purse discounts show, low-CML people are so unwilling to understand existing coins that they will pay 50% more for some goods, just so they don't have to use bitcoin cash.

The existing cryptocurrencies will still be around, and they will still appreciate greatly in value from what they are worth now. But I now expect their usage to continue to be limited to speculation and trading. If 1% of the world has used bitcoins so far, then I doubt that more than 10% of the population will ever own unpegged coins, despite 100% of people eventually using cryptocurrency. Bitcoin will become an even more valuable currency, but it will not become the dominant currency for everyday use because low-CML people will not take the time to understand it.

If you are trying to predict the future value of bitcoins or litecoins, the most important statistic you should be evaluating is what you believe the percentage of high-CML people in the world is. Since almost all the people reading this article are high-CML (given its length and the uncommon opinions presented), and most high-CML people associate with like people, I think they overestimate the percentage of high-CML people in the world. My belief is that the percentage is less than 10%, which is why stablecoins will dominate and bitcoins are very unlikely to ever meet the seven-figure valuations some users are predicting.",0.054,0.853,0.093,0.998

If you remember that night price was going down rapidly. I had a lot of short orders opened and many of them were closed by ""take profit"" price, with high positive P/L. In the morning when I woke up I checked up the terminal. Not too many of my short orders left, just about 5.5 BTC in orders. Problem was that I had a lot of long orders with big negative P/L, but I was fine because I still had a positive usable margin. Now I just write the log with time:



At about 8:23 AM I decided to remove take profit price, because I saw that the price will go down. I had a positive usable margin at this moment. I was unable to perform this action - the terminal logged me out. When I log in again I tried to remove take profit price again. It wasn't removed. I tried to close some big long positions but they won't close either.



Then at 8:29 AM cexbro team saw the issue and they put unscheduled maintenance mode.



Then during unscheduled maintenance, these positions were wrongfully filled (remember, I was trying to remove take profit price):



8542405198051:01:8621 01/07/2019 08:48 Buy 1.00 BTC/USD10,501.386003590.00518214 8537179198051:01:862201/07/2019 08:48 Buy 0.50 BTC/USD10,519.586003250.00226242 8537168198051:01:862001/07/2019 08:48 Buy 0.50 BTC/USD10,515.786003220.00295306 8537157198051:01:860501/07/2019 08:48 Buy 0.50 BTC/USD10,500.086003190.00326741 8536756198051:01:833001/07/2019 08:30 Buy 0.50 BTC/USD10,600.086003040.00394550 8536767198051:01:830301/07/2019 08:30 Buy 0.50 BTC/USD10,611.986003070.00100855 8544258198051:01:830401/07/2019 08:30 Buy 1.00 BTC/USD10,613.486003620.00444143 8541545198051:01:830201/07/2019 08:30 Buy 1.00 BTC/USD10,605.586003560.00831466   
 

After this, my margin fell below 0, because I had only long positions opened. I could not open new short positions at this moment since my usable margin was negative.



At 11:24 AM they send a ridiculous email saying that issue is probably in my browser. I did, however, what they were asking but nothing changed, because the problem was definitely on their side. Somewhere at this point, I noticed that what I was seeing in the terminal had absolutely nothing to do with the real state of the account. I could see some positions that were closed already in the terminal as still opened.



At 11:39 AM, they sent me an email saying that they finally allowed deposits again for my account. At this point, I could add enough liquidity to the account to avoid a margin call. But I decided that this is unsafe to put any money in the system when it's in a state of a complete mess. I couldn't even make an account statement to give them positions that were wrongfully filled.



At 2:49 PM, they sent a big email confirming that issue was on their side and promising compensation of 0.61 BTC (and no, they didn't pay it later)



At 3:31 PM, I sent an email, with my concerns of that because of wrongful filling of my short orders in the morning my account might be in danger of liquidation.



Ar 4:00 PM, they reassured me that I will get compensation for any additional losses.



At 17:10 PM, I asked them to speed up the compensation process. That small compensation of 0.61 BTC they promised before actually could save my account from liquidation because I would get the additional margin to open more short positions.



At 18:56 PM, they decided to close all my long positions, causing the damage of about: 6.33-1.15=5.18 BTC. At that time price has risen, and I should have about 50% margin cover.



After a week of exchanging email with support, including having conversations with their ""Supervisor of VIP Customers Claims"" guy (who probably spent more time typing large emails than actually looking into an issue) I decided to share the story.



The only thing I regret is time and effort I put into helping them to build a better product. But ""A fish rots from the head down""...



I don't really think they would return anything anyway. But if you want to help - please spread this information.

If you have funds on their accounts - be aware of ""unscheduled maintenances"", this can cost you money.



Now I wouldn't trust them even one satoshi. And probably will withdraw leftovers IF they enable withdrawals for my account.





Today you can pass by and do nothing. But remember this:



""First they came for the socialists, and I did not speak out—

Because I was not a socialist.

Then they came for the trade unionists, and I did not speak out—

Because I was not a trade unionist.

Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out—

Because I was not a Jew.

Then they came for me—and there was no one left to speak for me.""



To end on a good note, couple hilarious quotes from support with my comments:



""we suppose the issue is related to your own browser. Please go to your browser settings, clear your Web Browser cookies and internet cache, shut down your browser and re-open it."" (C) Morgan Larsson

\- Sure, that definitely would do the job!



""In addition, the system may become unavailable to you at any time for other reasons - for example, a problem with the Internet, or for instance a problem with Cloudflare which took place recently."" (C) George Thompson

\- Sure, or a huge meteorite could strike the Earth...



""If you encounter problems which are the reason you suffered additional losses due to our fault, we always investigate each case and we compensate all the losses.""

""We found out that you were not able change the take profit of your Short positions, because at that time the system was already partially or completely unavailable."" (C) George Thompson

07/16/19,"Nowadays, the Bitcoin currency rate perhaps is the most unpredictable thing. All predictions about how BTC price will increase or drop are in some way similar to the weather forecasts. No one can tell what will happen to the coin tomorrow. One of the most important factors that experts rely on is the history of the currency rate over the whole period of BTC existence with its dynamics. It is essential to know what was happening to the coin as this allows you to understand what can happen to it in the future.

# 2009

The first digital currency – Bitcoin – came to the world on January 9, 2009. In the same month, the creator of Bitcoin mined the first block and he also made the first financial operation in the BTC system.



At the beginning of its history, the Bitcoin price was ridiculously low. The first exchange of BTC to US dollars was made in the summer of 2009 when Martti Malmi received 5.02 USD for his 5050 Bitcoins.



The first official Bitcoin exchange rate to the fiat dollar was established on October 9, 2009. At that time, for 1 dollar you could buy 1 309.03 BTC. Many people now regret that they missed the opportunity to buy Bitcoin for pennies.

# 2010

In 2010, events in the cryptocurrency market began to develop more intensively. The Bitcoin Market exchange was opened in February 2010, where it was possible to sell the digital coin. In May of this year, the most well-known deal with Bitcoin had happened. The programmer Laszlo Hanyecz bought 2 pizzas for 10,000 BTC. It was the first purchase using cryptocurrency in the real world. He posted a request on the crypto forum saying that he wanted to buy two pizzas. In exchange for that, he offered 10K Bitcoins that back then cost about 40 dollars. And there was a person who agreed to have this deal – it was the 19 years old Jeremy Sturdivant. Jeremy didn’t become a millionaire since then as he spent his coins to travel across the USA.



As for Laszlo, he doesn’t regret about the lost millions. He was mining coins for his pleasure at that time and spent them to different non-significant things.



In July of 2010, BTC price raised to 0.08 dollars. Then in November, the price went up for 50 percent. In general, 2010 was an excellent period for strengthening the position of Bitcoin. The digital currency was almost able to reach the point of one dollar.

# 2011

BTC overcame the point of 1 dollar only in February of 2011. By early June, the price had grown to 10 dollars. This was a small victory for Bitcoin. Another maximum was set at the point of $31.91. In the middle of June 2011, there was a sharp drop in price: from 31.91 again to 10 dollars.



The year 2011 was full of negative events. One of them happened on June 13, when a user’s electronic wallet was first hacked and 25 thousand coins were stolen from there. In a few days, some geeks hacked MtFox exchange where they got data of sixty thousand users. These events negatively affected the Bitcoin rate. It became clear that in the future the price of digital currency will be determined taking into consideration any events that occur in the market.

# 2012

In 2012, the exchange rate was ranging from 8 to 12 dollars per 1 BTC. This period was also rich in significant events. One of them is that **Bitcoin Central bank began its work**. This bank received a license and was even recognised by European regulators.

# 2013

February 22, 2013, was the day when Bitcoin began to grow again. The price reached the mark of $30. Another increase occurred at the end of January – $31.9. The upward trend continued. March 22 rate was 74.9 dollars per BTC.



On the first day of April, the price went up to $100 and within another nine days, the BTC price grew to 266 dollars. But the growth did not last long. By October it was $109. The possible reason for that is the arrest of an anonymous trading platform Silk Road.



Since November 2013, the price of Bitcoin began to grow anew. By the end of the month, the price exceeded all expectations and raised up to $1,200 per coin. The reason for overcoming the $1,000 point was the BTC support by Zynga game creator. Experts also noted another event that could affect the growth: one of the higher education institutions in Cyprus started accepting the Bitcoin as payment for tuition.



But by the end of the first week of December, the price was 1,000 dollars. In the middle of December 2013, the BTC price dropped to 600 dollars because the China Central Bank prohibited the country’s financial institutions to maintain operations with cryptocurrency.

# 2014

During the year 2014, there happened rather a significant amount of events that had an impact on the Bitcoin volatility. In the first days of January, 1 BTC was equal to 770 dollars. In February it was 700 dollars. Summer 2014 slightly strengthened the reputation of the cryptocurrency.



Many experts think that it was 2014 when BTC strengthened its position in the market, in spite of the fact that Bitcoin price was low – by the end of the year it settled in at around 310 dollars. In 2014 **investors began to consider Bitcoin as a potential investment** as Bitcoin price predictions seemed quite attractive.

# 2015

At the beginning of 2015, the BTC price started rising: with 177 dollars in January to 281 dollars to March. The number of people who were trading Bitcoin increased – there were about 160,000 people was buying and selling BTC on exchanges by August 2015. In one period of 2015 the Bitcoin price grew up to 500 dollars, but to the end of 2015, it dropped to about 350 USD.

# 2016

In 2016, Japan declared Bitcoin as a currency and allowed to use it to pay for goods and services. South Africa was the next who did the same. In April 2016, BTC rate went up and reached $454 per coin. By the end of May, 1 BTC was already worth $600. The reason for the price increase might be the growth of the number of transactions in the Chinese market. The highest price in 2016 was in December – $950 for one Bitcoin.

# 2017

The year of 2017 was an incredible period in respect of BTC price. It started with $1,000 for 1 coin. Already in June, it was $2,600. By the beginning of September, the price jumped to $5,000 per 1 BTC. On December 17, the Bitcoin price achieved a record and was over 20,000 US dollars.



**How did this happen?** Here are some reasons that experts point due to the growth of Bitcoin price:



* In 2017 social media broadcasted a lot of information about Bitcoin and the blockchain system;
* China resumed cashout of bitcoins from the Chinese cryptocurrency exchanges;
* In December 2017, the United States officially allowed trading futures for Bitcoin;
* The number of companies and people who were buying BTC increased as they considered Bitcoin the profitable investment and etc.



However, later in December, the price plummeted from 20 000 dollars to 12 000 dollars. Experts had different reasons including that one of the first cryptocurrency creators sold out all his digital savings and called such investments too risky.

# 2018

During the first 4 months of 2018, the price of BTC dropped below 7,000 USD. These negative dynamics were quite logical because the rise is always followed by the fall. For the first time since October 2017, the Bitcoin price fell below 6,000 dollars. On November 25, the price of Bitcoin fell even lower – $3,676 per 1 BTC. By mid-December, the bitcoin rate fell by almost 80% to its yearly rate, the price was $3,200.

# Nowadays

What can we expect in 2019? What Bitcoin price predictions do crypto experts have? People hope that 2019 will bring new opportunities for Bitcoin and also other cryptocurrencies. Some investors and crypto enthusiasts predict that the BTC price will grow to 40 – 50,000 USD by the end of 2019. One of them, John McAfee, is assured that the price will rise to 1 million dollars by the end of 2020. He even had a bet that he posted in his Twitter saying that he would eat his “love muscle” if his BTC price prediction will not come true.



**There may be a number of factors that can influence the BTC price in 2019.** They are:



* Nasdaq, the world’s second largest exchange plans to launch futures for Bitcoin;
* Coming out of the first crypto-ETP in the world;
* and many other unpredictable factors that can change the price of Bitcoin.

As it was said before, Bitcoin price predictions are almost like the weather forecast – you never know what price it will have tomorrow. If you think about investing in BTC or any other cryptocurrency you should follow its rate at present time but never forget to compare it to the past. But please, don’t bet to eat any of your body parts 🙂

07/17/19,"I had some requests to post this from the Daily to a separate post:

This post is going to discuss alts, but only in the context of their ratios, and contains useful information for those who are trading BTC against alts either short or long, with the objective of acquiring more BTC. 

I made a spreadsheet of the top 10 alts, leaving out USDT and BNB. The dataset I used is the all time historical data from CMC for each coin. I am posting some conclusions from it comparing their BTC ratios over a long term 

The tl;dr:

1. every alt checked has a median negative return in terms of its BTC ratio (even the ones with lifetime BTC ratio gains);
1. every alt shows ~80 to 87% loss of BTC ratio from all time high (BSV is an outlier. Do you really think it won't keep falling?);
1. The above two points are related, and taken together mean that, on average, each day you are more likely than not to lose BTC value in every alt examined;
1. as a corollary from the above, the fact that some alts haven't given up 100% of their BTC gains means that the days they do increase, they increase disproportionately, but not all alts do this, and none of the alts have done so since their respective ATH;
1. the timing of the ATH's indicates there was no alt season. What actually happened was a series of pump and dumps brought on by the ICO craze. The fact that some peaked well before the BTC ATH, and some peaked well after, combined with how quickly they collapsed, indicates there was no ""season. By the time ETH was at ATH, XRP was already down 55% from its ATH. By the time BCH was peaking, ETH was already down 67% from its ATH. When XLM and TRX peaked, BCH was already down 34% from its ATH (just 14 days later!). When EOS was hitting its ATH, XLM was down 19% and TRX was down 29%.
1. Leaving aside LTC and BSV as outliers (too early and too late respectively), ""alt season"" ran:

&gt;* May 17, 2017 XRP ATH;
&gt;* June 12, 2017 ETH ATH;
&gt;* December 20, 2017 BCH ATH;
&gt;* January 3, 2018 XLM ATH;
&gt;* January 4, 2018 TRX ATH;
&gt;* April 29, 2018 EOS ATH;


My conclusion is that alts will have pump and dumps from time to time, but almost without exception decrease in value relative to Bitcoin. This makes them a very poor indicator for those looking to trade the ratios to acquire more BTC. The pump will come out of nowhere and fade away just as fast. Missed opportunities can quickly turn what would have been a profitable flip into a massive loss. 

Similarly, the unpredictability of these pumps makes leveraged shorts dangerous as fuck. Very few readers can survive their short going under water by 300 or 400%. There seems to be a lot of long term profit in BTC in shorting these things, but tight stops and willingness to reexamine the market is crucial. 

If you can catch the right pump and abandon your alt before it dumps, you can increase your BTC stack. The time frame for doing so is small. If you can catch the right pump and short the shit out of it, you could make a ton of BTC. 

If a coin has a major (200% pump), every pump after that one is less than the previous. 

Alt season was never really a thing, and is simply a by-product of having thousands of shitcoin ICOs all entering the market at the same time. The timing of the pumps among the coins doesn't even line up well with anything. 

My theory: alt coins will generally have unpredictable temporary breakouts to historic ATH on the BTC ratio. After the breakout they will continue their gradual slide from ATH to 0BTC.

There is no evidence to suggest that the coins that reached significant ATH and withdrew more than 80% will ever see another such pump again.

I’d like to be able to backtest using certain indicators and also set auto-trades with certain parameters, I guess build a bot...

I know nothing about programming so I will need to start from the ground up, or utilise any free services out there if anyone knows of any. I’m willing to put the work in, I just don’t know what to search for to get started! So I have a few questions:

What programming language will I need to know?

Are there any sites that do this for free or a small(ish) fee? 

What software will I need? 

Where do I pull the data from needed for a backtest?

07/26/19,"Anybody get their letter yet?

Edit: Here are the actual letters being sent out. There are three, and the IRS picks which one to send you based on how bad they think you are. [6174] and [6174-A] are FYI, but [6173] requests a signed response letter.



The Internal Revenue Service has begun sending letters to more than 10,000 cryptocurrency holders, warning about penalties for failing to report income and pay tax on transactions involving virtual currencies.

The agency expects its mailing to be completed by the end of August. It is sending three variations of one letter, depending on the information it has about the recipient.

“Taxpayers should take these letters very seriously. The IRS is expanding efforts involving virtual currency, including increased use of data analytics,” said IRS Commissioner Chuck Rettig.

An IRS spokesman declined to say whether the letters stem from information turned over by digital-currency platform Coinbase. In mid-March of 2018, Coinbase provided data—under a federal court order—on about 13,000 accounts requested by the IRS.

One version of the letter recently uploaded to the IRS website asks recipients who believe they have followed the law to sign a statement declaring, under the penalty of perjury, that they are in compliance with tax rules. It also notes says that the recipient should understand the IRS may be in touch with them.

In recent weeks, IRS criminal investigations chief Don Fort has announced that the agency is also building criminal tax-evasion cases involving cryptocurrency that are expected to be made public soon.

The Coinbase customers whose information was turned over bought, sold, sent or received digital currency worth $20,000 or more between 2013 and 2015.

For federal tax purposes, cryptocurrencies such as as bitcoin are treated as investment property akin to stock shares or real estate.",0.096,0.874,0.03,-0.9731
07/27/19,"**tl;dr** You may not owe tax for unreported gains more than 3 years past the filing date, but don't count on it. The IRS may have ways to extend this time. Talk to a credentialed tax pro (CPA, Enrolled Agent, or Tax Attorney) if your underreported amount is significant. Also, talk to a tax pro or tax lawyer if you use non-US exchanges, as there may be severe reporting penalties even if you reported your tax accurately.



**3 YEARS OR 6 YEARS?**

The IRS has a statute of limitations for auditing tax returns. Generally this statute is **3 years** from the original due date of your 1040 return, or from the date you filed the return, whichever is later. If you filed your 2015 and prior returns before July 2016, you *may* be off the hook for errors or omissions on those returns. 

However, there are ways for this timeline to be extended to **6 years**, or in some cases, **indefinitely**. 

The main way to get a 6 year statute is to by having underreported gross income of 25% of your reported income (such as net gain from crypto sales). [This article] gives details on how to calculate if you underreported by 25%. If you have a crypto business, such as mining, this may be calculated differently; see the article notes on Trade or Business.

The other way to get this extended is if you filed a late or inaccurate form 8938 to disclose foreign accounts, or if you committed fraud. See the following sections.



**FOREIGN ACCOUNT REPORTING** 

The **other way** **to extend** the statute is to not file a required form 8938 with your return. 

What's an 8938? 8938 is required to report foreign asset accounts if your total, aggregate foreign account value is over $50,000 (or higher, depending on your situation) during the year. Currently, it appears that crypto wallet holdings that you hold yourself are not subject to reporting on 8938. However, you do need to report crypto and cash holdings in non-US online exchanges and custodial accounts.

So how does this extend the statute? If you didn't file the 8938 with your original return, the statute stays open until 3 years after you file the 8938. The statute becomes extended to 6 years if you underreported income or assets that were, or should have been, on the 8938. 

There are also separate penalties for failure to file an 8938, so if this is your issue, talk to a tax attorney with foreign reporting experience. There are processes to potentially reduce your penalties, but foreign reporting is a tricky area.

*Form 8938 is not to be confused with the* [FBAR] aka FinCEN form 114, which is a non-IRS Treasury form that is very easy to have a filing requirement for. If you have non-US accounts which in TOTAL are worth over 10k at ANY TIME in the year, you must file the FBAR the following year or face large penalties. Included in this requirement are any foreign accounts you are a signer for, even if the account is owned or managed by someone else; and accounts you have part ownership in, even if you aren't a signer or user of the account.*



**TAX FRAUD**

The unlimited statute of limitations is for civil fraud cases. If you had significant crypto gains (not losses) that you intentionally failed to report on your return, this could be you. The civil fraud penalty is an additional 75% of the underreported tax.

There is also criminal tax fraud. The IRS tends to reserve criminal prosecution for the most egregious, high-profile or big-money cases. If this is you, talk to a tax attorney and no one else. A non-attorney tax pro could be subject to a  subpoena to disclose the contents of your discussions in your criminal trial.



**I THINK I'M OUTSIDE OF STATUTE - NOW WHAT?**

If the IRS makes a significant adjustment to your return in an audit, you can usually expect them to assess a 20% accuracy penalty on the additional tax as long as fraud is involved. If you're  safely out of statute and you haven't yet been audited, the IRS cannot assess additional tax. You can voluntarily file an amended return and pay the additional tax. 



**CONCLUSION**

Most of this sub's underreported gains, especially massive gains, will be for 2017. Right now is prime time for IRS audits of 2017 returns. Get that amended return in ASAP to avoid a 20% accuracy-related penalty. If you might be guilty of civil fraud, amending is still probably the best bet, but talk to a tax attorney about your options.

**12-MAY-2019 Cryptocurrency (Elliott Wave): Sell In May And Go Away?**

**28-JUL-2019 Cryptocurrency (Elliott Wave): Inflection Point**



____


From the 2018 bear market low set on 15-DEC-2018, the Bitcoin bull market has gained 340% into the high of 26-JUN-2019. Since then, the largest pullback of the 2019 bull market has been underway, thus far a 35% decline heading into AUG-2019.

From an Elliott Wave perspective, two scenarios can now be considered at this inflection point: a continuing **Bull Scenario (Preferred)** or a **Bear Scenario (Alternative)**. 

In either scenario, the following Elliott Wave model proposes a five wave structure, consisting of: three advancing bull market waves, interwoven with two declining bear market waves. Overlaying this model onto Bitcoin suggests:

    Wave 1: the first bull market wave 2010-2013 (1219 days), followed by;
    Wave 2: the first bear market wave 2013-2015 (426 days), followed by;
    Wave 3: the second bull market wave 2015-2018 (1065 days), followed by;
    Wave 4: the second bear market wave 2018-2019 (363 days), followed by;
    Wave 5: the third and final bull market wave 2019-?

The five aforementioned have been considered as PRIMARY degree waves —such waves elapse the course of a few months to a couple of years. Each PRIMARY degree wave is constituted of five INTERMEDIATE degree waves; and in turn, so forth into smaller degree fractals. 

—BLX: 

The continuing bull market scenario suggests the first INTERMEDIATE leg of PRIMARY[5] has completed, and four more INTERMEDIATE degree waves are yet to unfold; either meeting or exceeding the all-time highs of PRIMARY[3] wave.

The alternative bear market scenario suggests PRIMARY[5] has completed in entirety, and failed to meet or exceed the all-time highs of PRIMARY[3] wave. In Elliott Wave parlance, this is known as a ‘failed-fifth’ or a ‘truncated’ wave.

____

**Bull Scenario (Preferred)**

—BTC: 

The preferred scenario suggests a continuing bull market is underway. PRIMARY[5] wave started from the 06-FEB-2019 low, and has completed its first leg labelled as INTERMEDIATE(1) wave at the 26-JUN-2019 high.

INTERMEDIATE(2) wave pullback is currently underway and expected to complete at the following Fibonacci retracement levels, using BITSTAMP prices:

    @8500: 50.0% Fibonacci retracement from 15-DEC-2018 to 26-JUN-2019 (min expected zone)
    @7230: 61.8% Fibonacci retracement from 15-DEC-2018 to 26-JUN-2019 (avg expected zone)
    @5425: 78.6% Fibonacci retracement from 15-DEC-2018 to 26-JUN-2019 (max expected zone)
    @4350: 88.6% Fibonacci retracement from 15-DEC-2018 to 26-JUN-2019 (WARNING)

Once INTERMEDIATE(2) pullback completes, INTERMEDIATE(3) wave is expected to resume the PRIMARY[5] bull market to meet and exceed the all-time highs of PRIMARY[3] wave.

Where the PRIMARY[5] bull market ends is open to interpretation and speculation. There are calls of $50,000 to $500,000 to $1,000,000 and even beyond…!

From an Elliott Wave perspective: A common wave relationship guides the price of the fifth wave to be equal to; or extend a Fibonacci 1.618 times; the length from the low of the first wave through to the high of third wave; projected from the low of the fourth wave. This provides a conservative target of the current bull market to conclude between $22,912 and $35,127, calculated using the BraveNewCoin (BLX) index:

    @22912: PRIMARY[5] = (PRIMARY[1] + PRIMARY[3]) * 1
    @35127: PRIMARY[5] = (PRIMARY[1] + PRIMARY[3]) * 1.618

—BLX: 

As and when the waves develop and progress, or in the event of subdividing and extending waves, revised price targets shall be calculated with renewed projections. 

If the current INTERMEDIATE(2) pullback retraces a Fibonacci 78.6% of the entire 15-DEC-2018 to 26-JUN-2019 uptrend, then the bull market has a 50/50 odds of resuming.

A retracement to the Fibonacci 88.6% level is the first warning signal to suggest the bull market may be over.

A decline to the 06-FEB-2019 low confirms the bull market is over.

____

**Bear Scenario (Alternative)**

—BLX: 

The alternative bear market scenario suggests the 2019 bull market was a short-lived affair, and PRIMARY[5] terminated as a failed-fifth truncated wave.

In this scenario, a CYCLE[II] wave pullback is now underway and headed to break below the 2018 low.

The following technical analysis motivations, in order of significance, support the bear market scenario:

1/ The cryptocurrency market breadth represented by the Altcoins have failed to materially participate in the 2019 bull market. The majority of Altcoins are currently approaching their respective 2018 lows.

2/ The last two monthly candles of Bitcoin, i.e. JUN-2019 and JUL-2019, are equivalent in formation to DEC-2017 and JAN-2018. Both sets of candlesticks formed a bearish ‘Shooting-Star’ and ‘Tweezer-Top’ pattern. A ‘Shooting-Star’ candlestick in an uptrend exhibits a long upper wick signalling a reversal. Two consecutive ‘Shooting-Star’ candlesticks form a ‘Tweezer-Top’ pattern: where the close price of the first candlestick is equal to the opening price of the second. A monthly close above $10,760 is required to obviate the bearish scenario: 

—BTC: 

3/ Perhaps superficial but worth consideration, is the current daily price action fractal which bears similarity to the 2017 top:

____

**Inflection Point Summary**

—A decline to $5425 (BITSTAMP) puts the bull market at 50/50 odds of survival.

—A decline to $4350 (BITSTAMP) provides a warning signal to suggest the bull market may be over.

—A decline to the 06-FEB-2019 low confirms the bull is over.

—A monthly close above $10760 (BITSTAMP) provides a signal to suggest the bull market is resuming.

Last week we were fortunate enough to feature an [article] from a very good trader and friend of mine I wanted to share it with you all.



Hope it helps!



**How to Make Trading Your Full-Time Career: Tips From a 7 Figure Trader**



\-------------------------------------------------------



Where to start? How to become a trader? How long does it take? What type of trader should I become? How hard is it to become a full-time trader?



I can’t even begin to explain how many times these questions have been asked to me over the past few years in conversation with friends, family and even new traders.



I’ve had numerous jobs in the private sector in which the path to the top is quite clearly defined; You start at the bottom (after some sort of formal education), after a few years of hard work you become manager and then slowly progress to the top after many hours of “working for the man”. The beauty about trading is that there is no generic path that anyone takes to become a full-time trader.



Personally, I’ve met people from all walks of life from university graduates, former professional athletes, people from traditional blue-collar jobs and the list goes on. There is no common feature I’ve noticed within the industry so in terms of what does it take to become a full-time trader? In my mind, it comes down to the sheer will power to succeed as a trader.



**Finding Your Trading Style**



Having attended university and studied Economics/statistics, my “edge” lies in the fact that I’m extremely competent with numbers and understand probabilities better than the average individual.



It’s very important to recognize early on what type of traits you have in life that give you an advantage over everyone else in the market.



Are you a person that has a very fine eye for detail? Are you good at long term strategy games? Do you have quick reflexes? Are you a patient person? These personality traits may be your biggest advantage without you even being aware of it.



Work with the traits that come naturally and don’t conform to what your twitter idol says about how you should trade. There are an unlimited amount of ways to trade the market so find what feels natural to yourself.



**Mindset**



I’ve recently seen all these “Youtube traders” that show off their Lamborghini’s, nice watches and penthouse views overlooking the beach.



These guys aren’t traders, they are marketers, that are feeding their lifestyle off people who believe trading is a way to get rich quick.



If you want to lose all your money within a month, then these are the guys to follow. The people that are actually making money trading are the ones that are locked away in a room for 15+ hours a day grinding away at work and trying their best to figure out how to trade. It blows my mind that attitude/mindset barley gets talked about with new traders.



In all honesty, I believe that mindset is single-handedly the most important thing to get right when starting out as a trader. You WILL get beaten, you WILL get burnt, you WILL go through rough patches as a new trade, this has happened to every successful trader so don’t think you are alone.



You must come into the trading space with an attitude to learn, trading is an art form that takes time to perfect, even once you believe you have perfected it, markets will change, and you will have to re-adapt.



Now If I’m being totally honest my mindset/goals don’t even revolve around dollars/coins anymore, my goals revolve around being the best trader I can possibly be and maximizing each and every opportunity to the best of my ability, with this mindset, money will inevitably follow.



**Risk Management**



So I want to split this up into two different sections, Beginners and anything past intermediate, so find which part best suits you.



**Beginners**



SMALL SMALL SMALL. START SMALL.



Hopefully by this point of the article you understand trading isn’t a get rich quick scam, but something you must devote a lot of time and energy to. You WILL lose money when you first start out trading so do yourself a favor and either trade with a trial account or trade with a minuscule amount of money that you don’t mind losing.



In terms of trading risk management, make sure you understand what type of trading style you are using and manage risk depending on this. Don’t overdo the leverage! Leverage is a marketing ploy to promote exchanges, so when an exchange states they offer 100x leverage, it doesn’t mean you should be using that amount of leverage! Play safe out there and use protection (stop losses).



**Intermediate +**



You guys should already know how to appropriately manage risk and have the basics down, so, I just wanted to share one thing with you all.



I see too many people get comfortable with doing “well” as a trader and becoming content with the amount of money they are making. Regardless of the reasoning, I’m under the belief that you should never be completely comfortable while trading or that’s a sign that you are not pushing yourself to your upper limit.



So long as you are a profitable trader my recommendation is to always be pushing more size and testing yourself. This doesn’t mean do 10x your normal position size but size up accordingly whilst managing risk.



**Putting It All Together**



Trading is a pure meritocracy, where your performance is all in the numbers and there is no one to blame but yourself for the PnL on your screen.



That’s why I love trading over any traditional job where you are stuck next to the useless person you work with having to pick up slack.



If you really want to escape that rat race and are really willing to put in the effort to become a full time trader, I wish you the best of luck and hopefully you too can make it!

07/31/19,"Despite the recent fall of Bitcoin prices by 33%, the situation on the market looks optimistic in the medium to long term, the CoinDesk analyst Omkar Godbole believes.

According to his observations, the three-day chart moving averages (MA) with periods of 50 and 100 formed the so-called ""Golden cross"", which is clearly a bullish signal. This intersection is observed for the first time since the beginning of February 2016.

The previous intersection of these MA took place on February 3, 2016, six months before the second halving in the history of Bitcoin. After that, the bull rally accelerated and in December 2017, the price of digital gold reached an absolute maximum near the $20,000 mark.

The third halving should take place in May 2020, that is, in less than a year. It will reduce the amount of regular emission, and thus, making the first cryptocurrency more scarce. A decrease in the market supply of an asset with constant or growing demand is known to inevitably push the price up.

Investors' optimistic expectations are likely to push the price to new heights in the medium term. Also, according to the efficient market hypothesis, history repeats itself. Thus, the retest of the heights reached at the end of 2017 is likely only a matter of time.

BTC is currently trading around $10,000, which is 31.55% below the June high at $13,880.

The bearish pattern of falling highs is still relevant. The downward slope of the 5-and 10-day MA is also not encouraging.

Bearish moods also find expression in RSI indicators, which are currently below 50. On the other hand, the decline in the values of this indicator has slowed significantly, indicating some easing of pressure from sellers. This hypothesis, in particular, is confirmed by the short stay of the price below the $9400 mark — buyers quickly won back the lost positions.

Thus, a psychological retest of $10,000 may be just around the corner. However, to get free from the clutches of bears, the price must overcome the level of $11,120, corresponding to the last falling maximum.

Earlier, Sebastian Sinclair expressed the opinion that in the short term bears control the situation on the market, as the price of Bitcoin is held below MA 50 on the daily chart.

If I have .1 BTC on Kraken, and I want to use 3x leverage.  What would be a safe amount to buy to avoid a margin call if the price drops by 30%?  


To explain further.  If I have .1 BTC on Kraken, and I use 3:1 Leverage to buy .09 BTC, am I only ""risking"" .03 of my .1 BTC on the exchange?  Does this allow me a significant larger margin for error than if I were to buy .15 BTC with 3:1 leverage ""risking"" .05 of my BTC?  


How can I calculate how much of a percentage of drop in the price would = the 80% margin call rate?  I've read through Kraken's website and can't figure it out.  There is never a listed liquidation price.  


Is this method more advantageous or less advantageous than having USD in my kraken account as collateral?  I'm currently avoiding fee's in my calculation, however I have checked out the git-hub fee and profit calculator.  


How much of an advantage am I gaining by making this leveraged trade?

08/08/19,"Hey all - Last week I interviewed Alex Kugelman, a tax controversy lawyer with expertise in cryptocurrency and IRS audits, about the recent IRS letters referenced as 6173, 6174 and 6174-A. Alex explained what each of the letters means, the  difference between them, and how they will potentially affect everyone who received one.

The letters intend to help taxpayers understand their tax and filing obligations and how to correct past errors. The recipients of these letters have been collected from various compliance measures, including the collection of records from Coinbase after their summons from the IRS in 2018 for 13,000 customer records.

Full disclosure, I work for Bitcoin.Tax! Hope this helps clarify the letters for people who have either received them, or heard/read about them.

Highlights from the episode:

**The Three Types of IRS Notices (01:15):**

*“There’s  basically three different letters: 6173, 6174, and 6174-A that were  sent out to Coinbase account holders for the years 2013 through 2015 as a  result of that summons that the IRS sent to Coinbase. Essentially,  Coinbase and the IRS agreed on a certain threshold. That means about 13,000 or so account holders information, including name, social  security number and trading data, was provided to the IRS. If you go on  the IRS website or call the IRS hotline regarding these letters, these  are in fact those people that are being affected.”*

**The Difference Between Each Letter (02:15):**

*“The  basic thrust is that the IRS has information that the recipient had  some cryptocurrency account and may not have fully reported gains or losses from the activity. So essentially the 6174, 6174-A, and 6173 are  essentially predicated on that. The 6174 is what’s been termed, or  people have described as, a ‘soft notice' – just putting people on notice of what the tax reporting obligations are. The 6174-A is a little  bit more direct. The 6173 from my perspective is the letter to be taken  more seriously by recipient because it requires a response. It has a  response date, from what I can tell, of one month from the date of the  letter.”*

**The Goal of the IRS Letters (08:50):**

*“I  would imagine probably two goals of these letters. One is for the group  of people who actually received the letters. For each of them to address any outstanding issues – voluntary compliance to get as many  people in compliance to all tax reporting obligations. The second, which  I think has been really effective, is to spread this news to a wider audience – this was all over the Internet. That’s exactly how the IRS motivates people to comply with tax laws: get the word out and get  people thinking ‘right now I have to really take this issue seriously’.”*

**What the Letters Mean for Crypto Users (10:45):**

*“For  people who just purchased and held onto crypto, what you want to do is  just keep good data, good records, but you really don’t have anything to do. However, if you did receive the 6173, then you would respond. You  could respond that you don’t have any taxable gains or losses or tax  reporting for those years, but pretty much get your records together and  just kind of hunker down. ”*

*“For people who had net losses…I’ve gotten this question a couple of times:  the taxpayer made a bunch of trades, ultimately came out on the short  end of the stick and had losses and didn’t report anything because they  don’t have any additional tax owed. Subjectively that might be true, but  objectively that’s a major problem. If the data provided by the  exchange shows a certain number of taxable events or sales it’s not  clear from that data that there’s going to be a basis that exceeds what  the sales price is. For people that are in that boat, I would highly  recommend that they amend returns so you’re actually showing each of the  transactions and how you arrive at that figure.”*

*“I think at this point, especially if you got the letter…you’re now part  of a pool of certain taxpayers that has a lot of scrutiny.”*",0.026,0.909,0.064,0.9643

Short term who knows what happens to price, id argue the best strategy right now would be an aggressive DCA just in case it does have one more big leg down. Because Bakkt is physically Backed, and they are a multi-billion dollar dealing enterprise, i imagine their trading is going to have a strong effect on the market as it directly affects the supply (unlike CME). Ironically with CME, it wasn't popular to use until we bottomed and then all of a sudden some whale buys 80k contracts! Im sure its just a strange coincidence and convenience that all of a sudden futures were made available at 2017 peak, get barely used, and then a huge order comes in at the very bottom.

With Bakkt, thing is Bitcoin is less than a 300 billion MC. That's really small compared to the massive amount of money / connections the NYSE has. As well, soon you will have ErisX which is the Nasdaq version. Bottom line is these legacy wall street titan companies want to have a better control of the Supply, and thus will weed out any bullshit exchanges that can manipulate. NYSE wants to manipulate LOL, but i bet there is also some truth to it and they sincerely see the need/demand/business opportunity to create a trusted platform for a burgeoning new asset class. This is what ICE did for the energy markets, and if history is any guide, Bitcoin will become huge. I don't see how there can be any other way. There will now be a compliant trusted way for the biggest money to participate in the bitcoin economy and first things first is they have to establish positions. Once the MC of bitcoin is much higher , the booms and bust will be less, Bitcoin will in fact become ""Tame."" But the ppl with the foresight , long term vision and balls accumulating now and/or have been holding for years will get the biggest reward. I don't see any other way for this to unfold.

08/20/19,"Interesting POV is that CME knew they were going to offer futures, so them and their cohorts who basically control all the money pumped the shit out of bitcoin, got retail money sucked in, but mainly it was their money, then once it launched they strategically sold the market down throughout 2018, and then in the depths of the bear market, right at the end in Feb. 2019, when the volume is still low for Bitcoin futures, somebody miraculously buys 80k worth of contracts which is the equivalent of 400k bitcoin right at the bottom.  How convenient that futures were now available?! Since then we've rocketed up, but now we have Bakkt coming online (also Nasdaq's ErisX).  

So two scenarios here, one it was the same group pumping this current market since bottom so that once Bakkt comes online they will dump it like crazy and then get all their clients to start using their new exchange cause the prices are shit again.  The Other scenario is that we simply go on a full on Bull run, and they pump the market, suck in tons of retail again, and then do a massive dump and at the bottom the volume on their new exchange goes up.  

This is all just a theory based on coincidences, but it is a fact that there is massive money power within NYSE, Nasdaq and CME.  I remember an interview in 2018 at one of the conferences where a CEO at Nasdaq says on stage, you need us cause we Control ALL THE MONEY.

My options are: get a bank loan, create a legal fund for accredited investors, create an anonymous tokenized fund for anyone.

My strategy does involve margin trading and a certain amount of risk so in case of catastrophic events in the market there is a chance of losing all of the capital. That's why I'm hesitant about getting a bank loan, in case of a ""black swan"" I will be out of money and it would take quite a bit of time to repay it. I only have a certain amount of money to invest and my amount of ""play money"" is much smaller than many others.

I have spoken with a number of accredited investors and they are interested but they don't want just to make money, the want to make sure they get all tax reporting and even get to write off losses. Apparently having a winning strategy is not enough for them, there has to be a complicated legal structure that costs tens of thousands to set up.

This leaves me with an option of building a tokenized fund where all the capital is divided into crypto tokens and tokens go up in value as the fund value increases. This will allow regular people to invest their money at a reasonable rate, not the 3-5% you get in a savings account or GIC. But because I control the trading account it will still be centralized and raises an issue of trust. There have been so many scams and pyramids that I'm sure most people will be reluctant to invest.

**Bitcoin is confirmed for sub-$7,000 breakout if moves below $9,000 on bearish momentum.** 

At the end of June, Bitcoin might have been way overbought, and since then has been making a series of lower highs, telling us that the buyers were getting a little bit less enthusiastic. 

Now, the price is very close to a significant support level at $9,000, and the downside risk of breaking below $9,000 remains high. If the price declines below $9,000 per Bitcoin, it will be confirmed to go back down toward $7,000 or even lower.

Hi. I came across this blog post that links to this subreddit and wanted to get your opinion. It's from the CEO of a dex called BQT. Here's an excerpt:

""[I]n addition to the derivative nature of the contracts, BitMEX will let you leverage your position 100x. And I’m not opposed to big margins. I want that for BQT too, as I’ve mentioned here before. But that leverage has to come from your counterparty, not from me. So if 99% of your position is uncovered, and the other 1% is derived from bitcoin rather than being bitcoin itself — that is, there’s an infinite amount of it rather than the mere 17.3 million bitcoins currently in existence — then there really isn’t a lot of substance to what you’re trading. It all becomes pretty meaningless.
No wonder that “BitMEX” and “rekt” are two words that go together so intimately on Twitter, Reddit and I’m sure elsewhere.""

New to this sub but excited to allocate a portion of my account towards Bitcoin futures given my current macro perspective on everything that's going on.

So far only quants use our data. With the dashboard, our goal is to make a quantitative sentiment signal that is accessible for discretionary traders, too.

Some background on our technology: 

We spent the last months training an AI that identifies 93 emotions (*FOMO, Bullish/Bearish,  optimism, FUD*, ....) and topics (*hacks, scam, technical analysis*,...) in social media data (Reddit/Twitter/Bitcointalk) in real-time. 

This is the [full picture] of what our AI detects in online crypto discussions.

We would be happy to hear what you think and we’re looking for testers who want to test the signal (for free) and provide feedback.

Highlights:

**Basic Tax Planning Strategies (05:00):**

“The simplest thing you can do realistically, from a tax planning perspective, is be very aware of timing of your transactions. Generally you’re going to be better off if you spread out your cash out over two tax years, instead of bunching it up into the same tax year. For example, instead of selling everything at the end of December, if you instead sold half at the end of December and half at the beginning of January, that would have some really powerful effects. As simple as that concept is, you would lower your tax bracket for both years because you would have half as much income in each year.”

“The worst thing you can do from a tax standpoint is cash out everything right at the end of the year. Let’s say you cashed out on December 31st – your taxes are due on April 15th,  just three and a half months away. So not only did you perhaps put yourself into a higher tax bracket, you also have to pay that bill in just three months. Whereas if you waited one day and cashed out on January 1st you don’t have to pay any taxes until April 15th the following year – fifteen and a half months.”

“There is sort of an old saying in the tax world that a tax deferred is a tax avoided.”

**Charitable Remainder Trusts (12:25):**

“There’s actually many different variations of this structure. They’re all basically the same concept, just with some twists in terms of how they’re actually formulated. The basic idea is the same: you establish this special type of trust, a charitable remainder trust, and fund it with appreciated assets. You can do this with real estate, stock, or cryptocurrency. It doesn’t matter.”

“When you set up the trust and fund it with your \[Bitcoin\], you receive a charitable contribution deduction for setting that up. So that’s your first tax benefit. Then the trust can sell the bitcoin and it pays no capital gains tax. So that’s your second tax benefit there. The trust can then reinvest the proceeds from that sale into other income producing assets. And then what happens is the trust pays you an annuity for the rest of your life. That’s a guaranteed income stream – another benefit there. When you die, whatever’s left in that trust goes to charity.”

“There’s a lot of flexibility – the idea is that you are saving taxes, putting more money in your own pocket, and you’re benefiting charity.”

**Opportunity Zones (19:00):**

“The basic idea of the opportunity zone is that you can reinvest proceeds from the sale of an asset, like Bitcoin, within 180 days into what’s called an Opportunity Zone Investment – these are designated areas all around the country that Congress determined needed additional investment.”

“The rules on these are pretty complicated, but here are the basic benefits of investing in an opportunity zone: first of all, you have no capital gains on the Bitcoin you sold until 2026. That deferred gain is then reduced by 10% as long as you keep your investment in the Qualified Opportunity Zone for at least five years. It goes down by 15% if you invest by the end of \[2019\]. The big kicker is that you’ll never owe capital gains tax on the appreciation of the Opportunity Zone Investment as long as you hold it for more than 10 years.”",0.023,0.838,0.139,0.9967

09/30/19," 

Hi :) I’ve been developing an automated trader for last 2+ years and what I started with is far away from I ended up with.  
I'm all ears to hear from you how you use software that automates trading and if it helps you. Maybe you've got totally different point of view.

I started 2.5 years ago with excitement willing to press enter, lay down and just earn money with automation .. and I learned the hard way that **there is no point in creating software that automates making decisions**. I was just loosing too much money.

The market is so unpredictable that cost of supporting software with sensible prediction rate is just pointless.  
Instead, there is point in **automating execution of decisions made by human**.

**So, how to automate executing decisions? Example**

Imagine the following scenario.

At the beginning your wallet balance just before running automated trading software:

* TRX: 25030.38650000
* EOS: 61.18877000
* BTC: 0

**25.09.2019 - add automation for putting order when price meets given conditions**

* create sell order for 20% of TRX when price exceeds 0.00000165 BTC
* create sell order for 30% of EOS when price exceeds 0.0003800 BTC
* create buy order for TRX when the price drops below 0.00000158 for all available BTC
* create buy order for EOS when the price drops below 0.0003500 for all available BTC

That means that software would operate on 2 different currency pairs to gain more EOS and/or TRX (whichever is going to meet prices criteria first) and will buy EOS and/or TRX even If there is 0 BTC in wallet at the moment of turning on the automation for above currency pairs.

**27.09.2019**

What would happen? 20% of TRX would be sold.

Rest of orders would be still waiting to be created when prices change to meet the criteria. It might be possible these orders will be never created because market will not reach prices set few days before.

That means using software automating the trading need to be revisited and adjusted to the changing market if you think the prices won’t change to meet your criteria set at the beginning.



My point of view that when using software automating trading what you gain is **scaling**

* how many currency prices pairs at the same time you hunt for
* on how many exchanges and API keys
* how much time you're given back
* how quickly software will reprice the order unless it's out of range for your pricing criteria so your order will be filled
* **but it won't let you free from thinking at all**



That's my experience, mostly from programming (creating software) point of view. I know there are hundreds better traders here and I'm curious

**What were your expectations when started, how did your expectations change later?**

10/04/19,"There are many comments in the sub that there are still a significant number of longs in disbelief because of the persisting premium on BitMex futures despite the selloff from 14K

It’s true that we have for example seen ALTBTC futures go from premium for a while to finally a discount for Sep19 contracts and in recent sessions ETH has come back flat (even traded at a premium a short time), EOS is at a discount and XRP at a premium. So a mixed picture and an indication the market is more balanced than in the first half of the year and last year.

Regarding BTC futures Dec is still at a small premium 30usd and Mar20 more than 1 %

I am being told the main reason is that there are some tax-related reasons for that. Basically some whales + miners are sitting on capital gains but don’t want to pay taxes. So to cash out (a little - to pay utility bills or living expenses) they borrow (in the OTC market) USD or stable coins against  BTC collateral . These guys waiting for higher spot prices or tax status to change for selling for real - and paying back their loans. 

The effect from that is to make BTC lending rate cheaper than stable coin rates
Also to hedge their risk, (lending) market makers sell BTC for cash, buy BTC futures to keep exposure to the market and factor related costs of hedging and cost of capital into the stablecoin / USD rate to the borrower.

To counter that there is a natural flow from (spot) market makers who want to have BTC inventory, buy coins, hedge on BitMex futures and split their inventory on various exchanges to do arbitrage and market making. But these guys are price sensitive and don’t want to lock a discount when selling futures and need some premium to lock to make for the market-to-market risk.

There is a technical flow due to some tax related  trades that shift the ‘neutral’ level of the BitMex futures at some (small) premium.",0.025,0.919,0.057,0.7814

Also - I'll be talking with a crypto tax pro on our podcast about these guidelines soon. I usually post links to our podcast on this subreddit, so stay tuned (if you want...) for that in the next few days. Hopefully this helps some folks, as parts of the new guidelines are fairly ambiguous.

**Link:**  [

**TLDR:**

* Crypto is still subject to capital gains.
* Airdrops and forks are income on controllable receipt at Fair Market  Value (FMV). If you didn't have control, you don't have income.
* FMV should be taken from the traded exchange, source or value of  received services and not external sources, such as price aggregators.  FMV for an off-chain transaction is the value it would have had if it  was traded on the exchange.
* Peer-to-peer or other transactions use FMV from a source that  analyzes worldwide indices to calculate a value at that date and time.  Or, you can use an accurate representation of the FMV.
* Specific Identification is allowed (not just FIFO) when it can be documented. **\[new\]**
* Gifts are not income and giftee can use the documented gifted basis for gains (but not losses).
* Transfers are not tax events.

Generally, this is the same as the advice and common practice used by  taxpayers and accountants. Although, the exception here is the  clarification of the *specific identification* rule. We'll talk about that below.

**Summary:**

The IRS has issued their long-awaited guidance on the tax treatment for cryptocurrencies. You can read their [FAQ On Virtual Currency Transactions] on the IRS website.

This is the first official guidance since the original [2014-21 notice] in April 2014.

## IRS Cryptocurrency Tax FAQ

We have gone into more detail for some of the main points in their FAQ.

## Hard forks and airdrops

Despite peculiar wording by the IRS, they have confirmed that receipt  of crypto from an airdrop or fork is to be treated as income, and so  subject to income tax.

&gt;ordinary income equal to the fair market value of the new  cryptocurrency when it is received, which is when the transaction is  recorded on the distributed ledger, provided you have dominion and  control over the cryptocurrency so that you can transfer, sell,  exchange, or otherwise dispose of the cryptocurrency

However, these drops typically have no market (perhaps a futures  market) until they have existed for a period of time, so establishing a  value could be difficult. It is possible that the value could be zero  right at that exact moment it is *recorded on the distributed ledger*.

In order to receive income, you must have dominion and control over  these new crypto. This effectively means you must be able to manage it;  typically you would have the private keys or it is immediately available  in a custodial wallet or online account, e.g. Coinbase.

If the crypto doesn't appear in your wallet, or you don't get control  of it until a later date, then that later date is used to calculated  the USD income value.

This had been a common question among crypto traders: if BTC was  forked off into a new ""BTC"" coin, which you might not even have been  aware of, do you still have income? The answer is no. Unless, you  subsequently get access to those new coins, in which case you do have  income on the date you receive control.

When you have income for an airdrop or fork, this also sets the cost  basis (value and date) for any subsequent capital gains calculations.

## Fair Market Value (FMV)

FMV is used to give something a value, i.e. what it's worth. If you  list a bike for sale, you might research the prices for which other  people are selling. Those prices give a FMV. But it you sell your bike  and someone buys it for $100, then the bike's FMV was $100.

With crypto, sometimes we need to know FMV because we are not trading directly for dollars.

For example, if you sell 1 BTC for 150 LTC, you are disposing of the 1  BTC at FMV. You need to know the USD value in order to know the  proceeds and to calculate any capital gains or losses.

So, first, if this was traded on an exchange, we use the spot price  on the exchange at that time. This is true even if the transaction was  off-chain.

However, where no FMV exists, such as a peer-to-peer transaction, then you have to get the value from elsewhere.

So, secondly, use the FMV of the service or product you are  exchanging. With the above bike example, say buying it with crypto, the  FMV would be that of the bike itself (the price it would have sold for  USD).

Lastly, when no value can be obtained, then use a service that  provides a consistent worldwide indices value (the IRS are calling this  an ""explorer"" but that is a confusing term as blockchain explorers may  not provide a USD value). If you do not use an ""explorer"" value, you can  use an ""accurate representation of the cryptocurrency's market value"".  Much like with fiat, this means using an establish and consistent  source.

## FIFO and Specific Identification

Advice from most tax preparers and accountants has been to err on the  side of caution and go with First-In First-Out (FIFO). Basically, if  you bought 1 BTC for $9,000 and later another for $10,000, when you come  to sell 1 BTC (or partial) you would use the cost of the first 1 BTC  that you had acquired.

This is the default IRS cost basis method and would not be challenged.

Some taxpayers had filed using specific identification, where FIFO  was not used and instead the ""lot"" that was sold was chosen from their  wallets. Summary strategies could also be employed, such as Last-In  First-Out (LIFO), where the basis of the most recently acquired crypto is  used instead.

These other strategies, such as last-in first-out, closest-cost or  lowest-cost, often try to minimize the gains per transaction and defer  them until later.

This is the biggest change in the new IRS guidance and confirms that  specific identification can be used. However, you must be able to  document this, which the IRS describes as:

&gt;You may identify a specific unit of virtual currency either by  documenting the specific unit’s unique digital identifier such as a  private key, public key, and address, or by records showing the  transaction information for all units of a specific virtual currency,  such as Bitcoin, held in a single account, wallet, or address.This information must show (1) the date and time each unit was  acquired, (2) your basis and the fair market value of each unit at the  time it was acquired, (3) the date and time each unit was sold,  exchanged, or otherwise disposed of, and (4) the fair market value of  each unit when sold, exchanged, or disposed of, and the amount of money  or the value of property received for each unit.

There is no guidance if any extra information should be reported, but  it is generally the same information that is added to the 8949 form  where capital gains are reported.

## Gifts and Donations

Similar to gifts of stocks or property, the rules regarding cost  basis have remained unchanged. Received gifts are not immediate income  but you do still recognize an capital gains income when you later come  to sell, exchange or dispose of the cryptocurrency.

You can use the original basis (with documentation) from the giver in  order to make use of long-term gains. However, your received basis  becomes the lesser of the giver's cost basis and the FMV of the gift on  the date you received it. This is to prevent from gifting losses. Also,  if you do not have documentation showing the gift cost basis, then your  basis is zero, i.e. you must declare 100% as capital gains.

Donations to registered charities do not recognize income, gains or  losses. The value of your charitable donation is the FMV on the date of  the gift if you have held the crypto for more than a year. For a year or  less, it is lesser of the crypto's cost basis or its FMV on the day of  the gift.

## What was not mentioned

There are still some key questions and ambiguities that tax  professionals have been looking for clarification. For instance, with  hard forks and airdrops, if you have the private keys but no software,  does that count as control?

Airdrop and forks generally have no markets when they are created, so  is there a zero FMV? And should you take the value only when you  exercise control?

Can specific identification be used at will or must it be done consistently?

Were 1031 ""like-kind"" exchanges ever a valid approach before 2018?

## Guidance is retroactive

Finally, be aware that IRS guidance is always retroactive, unless  otherwise stated, and so should be applied to past and future crypto  transactions. If you have not followed these rules then you should  consult with your tax professional and may need to file an amendment.

\---



Edit:

According to /u/BitcoinTaxesMe:

&gt;I clarified a couple of the not mentioned ones with the IRS verbally yesterday. This isn't official guidance, but some insight into what the IRS is thinking:  
 
&gt;*""For instance, with hard forks and airdrops, if you have the private keys but no software, does that count as control?""*  
 
&gt;If you the software exists and you don't install it, but could have, it's income, even if installation presents a security risk.  
 
&gt;*""Airdrop and forks generally have no markets when they are created, so is there a zero FMV? And should you take the value only when you exercise control?""*  
 
&gt;There's no income recognized until you both have control and there's a way to sell it. So there's no way to take a zero basis, as soon as a market appears it triggers the 2nd prong.  
 
&gt;I personally think both of these are insane.",0.032,0.885,0.083,0.9976

**Summary/Highlights:**

**Two Components – Revenue Ruling &amp; FAQ (1:08):**

The revenue ruling creates some problems. The FAQ, for the most part, is not too problematic. But – I’d say on the net whole, both maybe create more questions than they answer, unfortunately.



**The Revenue Ruling – Airdrops &amp; Forks (2:28):**

Revenue Ruling 2019-24 is what the IRS released and specifically it addresses this issue of hard forks and airdrops, which until now has really gone unanswered. There’s been a lot of debate in the tax community about whether hard forks and airdrops are taxable events…whether they satisfy these kinds of requirements that we have from existing law for treating something as a taxable event. The big two are: do you have an ascension to wealth – meaning is the thing you received valuable? Number two, do you have dominion and control over it – meaning are you free to treat it as your own? If those two things are met, then generally speaking, you have taxable income.

The problem is applying those two standards to hard forks or airdrops is actually pretty difficult. The revenue ruling here attempts to make that application – but the problem is that the facts they use are problematic…and don’t seem to really adequately describe a hard fork or an airdrop. This revenue ruling is broken down into two situations where the IRS lays out the facts and then applies the law and reaches a conclusion about whether or not these events are taxable.

They say situation one is not a taxable event because the taxpayer did not receive additional units of virtual currency. But in situation two, the IRS says that it was a taxable event because the taxpayer not only received units of virtual currency from the followup airdrop, but also had dominion and control, because the taxpayer could immediately sell them if he or she wanted to. Situation one is not taxable. Situation two is taxable. So where do most hard forks like the BTC/BCH hard fork fit in? Strictly speaking, if you really took those revenue ruling at face value using the plain language, it doesn’t fit into either one because the BTC/BCH hard fork wasn’t followed by an airdrop.

This revenue ruling, like many issues that have come up with cryptocurrency, puts taxpayers in a really hard spot where they are left yet again guessing what the IRS wants them to do. If you don’t want to have any problems with the IRS in the future, I would tell you to go ahead and report every hard fork and every airdrop as a taxable event.



**The IRS FAQ on Virtual Currency Transactions – Specific Identification Methods (22:30):**

One of the big questions that’s been floating around the virtual currency space now for years is what methods do you use to calculate your cost basis? FIFO (First In First Out) is the default approach for shares of stock – so, kind of unsurprisingly, the IRS said in the FAQ Question #38 that FIFO is the default method also for virtual currency.

What was maybe a little bit surprising is that the IRS also says in Question #37 that you can use specific identification for virtual currency. This was actually a little surprising to me because the requirements for using specific identification for shares of stock is actually a little burdensome. In Question #37, the IRS sets what I would consider a pretty low bar to use specific identification for cryptocurrency transactions.

Specific identification would mean that instead of just assuming you’re selling your first Bitcoin, the oldest Bitcoin in your wallet, you can actually look at all of your holdings and pick which one you’re selling when you do a sale. So you could pick the one with the highest cost basis if you wanted (HCFO), or you could pick the newest one in your wallet (LIFO). So this opens up a lot of possibilities for taxpayers to be a little more strategic about how their gains are reported. Using specific identification, taxpayers can maybe choose the cost basis method that causes them to have the lowest amount of capital gains.

Most people listening should be relatively happy to hear that specific identification is possible. The question is what do you have to do to be allowed to use it? Question #37 says that you have to have records showing the transaction information for all units of the specific virtual currency held in a single account wallet or address. The question goes on to say that the information must show four things: the date and time each unit was acquired, your cost basis and the fair market value of each unit at the time it was acquired, the time and date each unit was sold or otherwise disposed of, and the fair market value of each unit when it was sold or disposed of. Well those are four things that we pretty much have already, every time we do a transaction with virtual currency – if you trade on coin on a Poloniex, when you download your transaction report, it’s going to show all four of those things every time.



**Unchanged Guidelines &amp; Unanswered Questions (29:43):**

I would say most things weren’t changed by this guidance. And that’s one of the things that’s maybe a little disappointing about the updated FAQ and the Revenue Ruling. A lot of it we already knew, especially in the FAQ – it kind of just flushes out some of the smaller points. But generally, the basic principles that we’ve been operating under for the last five years are all still in place.

We know that basically any transaction conducted with virtual currency is a taxable event and it’s generally capital gains and reported on Schedule D of your tax return. That part of it is still the same – nothing changed. The FAQ also addresses things like mining. We’ve known for a while that you have ordinary income based on the value of that coin at the time that it is mined. That logic would apply to staking rewards and other similar receipts of virtual currency. Also if you get paid in virtual currency, you know that’s taxable. Whether you’re an employee, or you’re a business selling goods or services, those are all taxable events.

There are still some big unanswered questions that we have and hopefully we get some guidance on that soon. I think the big thing they missed, and it’s really disappointing, was the issue about foreign account reporting.We’ve been asking this question now for five years or longer, about whether accounts held at foreign cryptocurrency exchanges are subject to reporting on FBAR or under FATCA on Form 8938. The question is, does an account at a foreign cryptocurrency exchange fall within the definitions used for the FBAR and Form 8938? And the answer is that we don’t know.



**Retroactive Guidelines (34:20):**

Most IRS rulings are retroactive unless otherwise stated. The Revenue Ruling and FAQ do not identify an exception to that. So I would say that these are retroactive.

Should you go back and amend past years? That’s a tough question to answer. I’d say talk to your tax preparer or advisor and see what they think. A lot of that depends on how much income it was, how much the rest of your income was on your tax return, how much time is left on the statute of limitations. It’s not an easy question to apply generally. But certainly you should look into it because the IRS will be following this revenue ruling retroactively.

10/18/19,"I am still working on my piece about what the true impact of a ""halving"" event in terms of the inflation of a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin is. That will come at some point in the future and will be furnishing with a model, rigorous analysis, and plots and things. In the meantime I have some thoughts that I would like to share in what should be about a 15 minute read. I will first present some general background, then a Bearish and Bullish perspective for the halving event. Finally I will share my own opinion about the impact of the halving.

\----------------------------------------

**Background:**



Suppose that Bitcoin as a network has some fundamental fair value. The question about whether the current market respects Bitcoin's fair value is irrelevant, we are just concerned that a fair value for the network is coherent and exists. This discussion will largely focus on how the halving impacts fundamentals despite the opinion that the market might not always respect them.

The current supply is 18M coins, but in practice, is probably closer to about 13M coins given the coins that are believed to be lost / orphaned. In the next twelve years or so, another 3 million coins will be generated which will increase the actual realized supply by about 20%.

The Bitcoin network enjoys security from mining. We can quantify the price of forking Bitcoin and re-writing the ledger as the cost of obtaining a near-majority share of the network's hash power. If we assume that the mining ecosystem today is basically honest or at least interested in the long term success of Bitcoin, then the cost of an adversary (such as some nation-state) to come in and obtain a majority hash power in the network is proportional to how much Bitcoin pay's its miners.





\------------------------------------------

**Bearish Perspective:**



From the point of view of miners, an average block is earning about 0.08 BTC from transaction fees these days with a coinbase reward of 12.5 BTC. This means that miners obtain roughly 99.4% of their income from the coinbase reward that inflates the currency, and 0.6% of their income is from transaction fees. That means that the security of the network is being paid for by users who hold the currency via inflation, and not by people who use the currency for transacting.

When the block reward is reduced from 12.5BTC to 6.25BTC, a few things could happen for miners. Let us consider the different possible outcomes:



(1) The transaction fees stay roughly the same and so the total income of miners is approximately cut in half (in BTC terms). If the fiat price of Bitcoin remains constant, then this outcome implies that the security (in terms of USD) of the Bitcoin network would also roughly be cut in half.

(2) The total income of miners stays the same in terms of BTC. This implies that the transaction fees will increase by about a factor of 50x as the burden of funding the network's security shifts from those who hold the currency to those who use the currency. The long term vision of the protocol is to eventually fund the network entirely using transaction fees.

(3) The total income of miners in terms of BTC drops, but the transaction fees also increase in a combination of (1) and (2).



What gives Bitcoin fundamental value is up to debate, but it stands to reason that the network's value is positively correlated with both its application for payments as well as its security (with respect to censorship) and consistency. Outcome (1) for miners implies that the security of the network will decrease dramatically as a result of the halving event. Outcome (2) suggests that Bitcoin may become extremely expensive to interact with it as transaction fees will grow immensely in terms of BTC which should also negative impact fundamentals.





\-----------------------------------------------

**Bullish Perspective:**



(4) Perhaps the most obvious bullish argument for the halving is that inflation applies an economic pressure that decreases the value of each unit of currency and so decreasing inflation reduces this pressure. A lot of users choose to think of this pressure as coming from miners selling or ""dumping"" their coins on the market, but really this is just a matter of supply and demand. If the market capitalization of Bitcoin remains constant, i.e. the market has settled on some fair value for the network, then with each passing day a coin represents a smaller fractional ownership of the network and is therefore worth less.

(5) A bullish counter-point to outcome (1) raised above is that the fundamental value the network derives from mining and security may not be linear. For example, if we double the amount of money that the network spends on mining through new coin production and transaction fees, the network might not be twice as good. At some point, the security of the network is good enough and we have hit diminishing returns on increased spending on mining. If we are currently in that state, where  Bitcoin is over-spending on mining, then decreasing that spending to reduce inflation should be a bullish thing.

(6) While not specifically related to the halving event, changes in fundamentals and deflation from lost currency compete with pressure from the inflation rate. Every day as users interact with Bitcoin, coins are lost due to death, faulty hardware, negligence and more. This puts a deflationary pressure on the currency as the effective supply is in constant decline. Additionally, aspects related to the adoption of Bitcoin, its normalization in our society, the regulatory structure surrounding it in major countries and more all contribute to the fundamentals and eventually price. It is possible that the price of Bitcoin is at a delicate tipping point where modest but constant improvements in fundamentals as well as deflation from lost currency is currently very carefully balanced by inflation, and a reduction in inflation will tip the markets into a bull-cycle.

(7) It is entirely possible that the price of Bitcoin is largely inconsiderate of fundamentals. The idea of a currency with a guaranteed fixed supply is both an easy narrative to understand and also emotionally compelling. Cryptocurrency market bull cycles are largely characterized by extreme cases of FOMO and so news about adjustments to inflation seem like a perfect catalyst.

(7.1) Another bullish argument  is to recognize that (1) and (2) are both very real concerns that should negatively impact the fundamental value of Bitcoin, but that a bull cycle fueled by the narrative of decreased inflation would cause an increase in the USD price of Bitcoin, and so although miners may be compensated less in terms of BTC, their income in terms of USD may hold constant or even increase, leading to an increase in fundamental network value. This would be a ""fake it till you make it"" outcome for the halving.





\-----------------------------------------------------

**Neutral Perspective:**



(8) In terms of who pays miners for the security that the Bitcoin network enjoys, there is a balance between holders, people who own the currency, and spenders, people who generate transactions on the network that pay fees. At the inception of Bitcoin, holders paid nearly all of the money responsible for funding mining with early transactions being accepted with no fee at all. Eventually, Bitcoin is programmed to operate with mining funded entirely by transaction fees with no inflation imposed upon holders. Somewhere in this spectrum of trade-offs there is an optimal configuration which maximizes the fundamental value of the network.

(9) It is possible that the network is in its most valuable configuration at the limit where transaction fees are entirely responsible for funding security. With each shift towards decreasing the contribution from holders we are inching closer and closer towards a more valuable network. These events will each correspond with an increase in market capitalization.

(10) It is also possible that the final configuration which funds mining exclusively by transaction fees is unstable. The seasonality of Bitcoin transactions along with the increased friction of payments may lead to a network with poor security properties which causes fundamentals and therefore market capitalization to decline. Miners already operate with an unprecedented amount of volatility and perhaps they really depend on their BTC income to be stable in order for their operating risks to make sense. Under these concerns it stands to reason that the most valuable configuration of Bitcoin has some fraction of miner income coming from inflation via new currency generation. Under this assumption, the value of  Bitcoin should increase as we approach this configuration and decrease as we move further away, so then the open question is, **""Is this optimal configuration in our past, present, or future?""**



\-----------------------------------------------------

**My Perspective:**



I am partial to (1) playing out, which is that the total revenue in terms of BTC paid to miners for each block after the halving will be only slightly more than half of what they are being paid currently. I believe that this negatively impacts fundamentals and I disagree with (5) in so far I do not believe that Bitcoin has hit significant diminishing returns in network security. I am not confident now that Bitcoin could withstand large scale attacks by nation states and I especially don't believe this in a future where executing such an attack is decreased by a factor of 2.



I am also partial to 6 and 7. I believe that generally speaking, the fundamentals of Bitcoin have been monotone increasing, meaning that things have really only gotten better for Bitcoin in the last few years. This does not need to be the case going forward, for example large government regulations could take away from fundamentals as well as attacks against the consistency of the network, but so far these things have not occurred. I also believe that the market for cryptocurrency is largely inconsiderate of fundamentals and so a narrative such as the halving which may not impact them could still be a catalyst for increases of 3x in spot markets. I believe that if this sort of scenario plays out, the effect on price is only temporary and will not be meaningful on longer time-frames (1-2 years). Trading cryptocurrency in the past few years has taught me to never be surprised that the market is not respecting fundamentals for months at a time and I have no idea what the time-frame of this event would look like.



I find (10) to also be intriguing. I actually believe that Bitcoin is currently pretty close to an ideal configuration in terms of where miner revenue comes from. I have done some light napkin math on the economics of different inflation configurations, and right now I am not in a position to say if this upcoming halving makes things better or worse, but I am confident that 4 halvings from now in 2032, the network configuration will be less favorable then it is now so we are not too far off.



\-------------------------------------------------------

**TLDR:** The upcoming halving of Bitcoin may have a number of impacts on the Bitcoin network and therefore spot markets that are both bullish and bearish. My personal opinion is that fundamentals will decline while temporarily the markets improve via trading the halving narrative, but eventually will converge to the decreased fundamentals. I have no idea what the time-frame of this temporary event would look like.

10/21/19,"(Oddly I posted this in /bitcoins and it was &lt;removedno idea why as it meets all rules...)

Here’s my theory around the last 24 hours and why the next year is going to be one hell of a good ride for Bitcoin...

Take a minute and consider how price responded the week Facebook announced Libra... the addition of 2 billion digital wallets, regardless that the focus was not on Bitcoin was a huge positive for us. As the Senate, the Fed.. mainstream media... all poo-poo’d the idea we then saw correlated pullback in price. Recently big names have been jumping ship... further eroding the hope for those +2 billion wallets. Enter the digital dollar discussion....

[

(Similar article is on Bloomberg behind a paywall if someone can grab it.. )

The timing of this discussion couldn’t be better. Last week the former chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission took out a full page ad pushing the eUSD along with this opinion piece.

[

And then we had both the European Central Bank and some at our own Fed begin openly considering or endorsing the idea..

Germany’s finance minister in July stated they could not allow Libra, now he’s pushing for a national German cryptocurrency... [

Members of Congress have formally asked the Fed to get on board..

[

And now even the Fed admits it is  ‘actively debating’ the idea when just two months ago they stated there was no need or interest to do so

[

Even mainstream financial conversation are starting to see the benefits of the eUSD especially as we get closer to the next recession

[

The people behind LIbra project are now shifting their position and considering not using a ‘synthetic basket’ of currencies but instead peg the Libra directly to national digital currencies. Even better, Zuckerberg is scheduled to testify in form of Congress Oct 23 (Wednesday) and I will place a strong bet that his response to attackers on the Libra project will be what his team just ‘floated’... “Fine, if you launch a digital currency (eUSD) then we will build on top of that and all (most) of your concerns will disappear.....but if you don’t we are moving forward regardless”.

We will then spend the next 3-4 months watching the debate in Washington to launch eUSD accelerate 10x... with a lot of movement but in general half commitments and vague statements... until eYuan. China has already stated they are working on their own digital currency and while they backpedaled a bit last month, that was likely due to difficulties on the development side (cause, you know...coding is hard) and not a real change in intention or goals. They want a digital currency that allows them to shift the commerce they control to something other then the USD. They do trillions of business with countries other then the US and so the move has real implications (note the US is actually China’s third largest trading partner exporting $1.6 trillion. In 2018). It not only reduces the power the dollar has over them, it helps blunts the impacts US tariffs have on their economy.

Immediately after China’s official announcements, the US will likely act like they’ve been ‘onboard’ to launch the eUSD from the beginning, and are working quickly to get there. These two world leaders, China and US will create far more then Facebooks 2 billion digital wallets... and the new space race to launch a digital currency will have been started for EVERY country in the world. I’d expect the eEuro will announce sometime after China and the US, they tend to need to talk and debate for 2x longer then other countries on major EU policies (which is understandable given their diverse political make-up).

Here’s the timeline I see as realistic:

* Last Week : Both FB Libra and some in congress and the Fed, ‘Float’ the benefits of eUSD 
* This Week : Zuckerberg w/ Congress  lays out the challenge “IF you build it, THEN we use it, ELSE we build our own”
* Next Week : The conversation around the eUSD intensifies as the alternative (not doing something) isn’t realistic 
* 3-4 Months : China officially announces the limited launch of their eYuan 
* 5-6 Months : The US having debated and half committed for months reacts with full commitment 
* 6-9 Months : Every country in the world is either developing their own digital currency or aligning with a partner

&lt;Did I mention the Halving?,,,,, yeah it’s right there in the middle of those last 3 milestones...&gt;

And to be clear, Bitcoin doesn’t need to be ‘the’ currency... but it will almost certainly be available in 99% of all digital wallets people use. It might not be in the official Chinese or US wallet but no one will use ‘just those’... and it’s digital so it really doesn’t matter. The eUSD and eYuan will trade on the same exchanges you trade bitcoin today, even better the lines between traditional forex trading and crypto trading will almost immediately blur. The confidence in Bitcoin, and blockchain as a whole will SKYROCKET... Imagine 2billion+ crypto onramps... that don't require fiat deposits because your national currency is already digital. 

The second greatest thing to happen with Bitcoin price will be an the launch of an ETF.. but I’ll explain why that will happen in the next 12 months as well, in my next post.

Btw, this is obviously all just my opinion and I am posting so that others (possibly smarter then myself) can punch holes and refine the theory. So you don’t need to be a dick, just explain where or why my hypothesis breaks down and let’s figure this shit out.

The 2019 Bitcoin bull market parabolically surged 345% from the low of 15-DEC-2018 to the high of 26-JUN-2019. Since the 26-JUN-2019 high, the market was spooked with a 48% decline into the low of 23-OCT-2019.

From an Elliott Wave perspective, two scenarios are under consideration at this inflection point: a continuing **Bull Scenario (Preferred)** or a **Bear Scenario (Alternative)**.

In either scenario, the Elliott Wave model proposes a five wave structure, consisting of: three advancing bull market waves, interwoven with two declining bear market waves. Overlaying this model onto Bitcoin suggests:

    Wave-1: the first bull market wave 2010-2013 (1219 days), followed by;
    Wave-2: the first bear market wave 2013-2015 (426 days), followed by;
    Wave-3: the second bull market wave 2015-2018 (1065 days), followed by;
    Wave-4: the second bear market wave 2018-2019 (363 days), followed by;
    Wave-5: the third and final bull market wave 2019-?

—BLX: 

The five aforementioned have been considered as PRIMARY degree waves —such waves elapse the course of a few months to a couple of years. Each PRIMARY degree wave is constituted of five INTERMEDIATE degree waves; and in turn, so forth into smaller degree fractals.

The **Bullish Scenario (Preferred)** suggests Wave-5 is still underway, and the bulls shall be treated to subdividing and extending waves headed for new all-time highs.

The **Bear Scenario (Alternative)** suggests a trick Wave-5 completed at the 26-JUN-2019 high as a truncated fifth wave failure, and a bear market is underway.

____

**Bull Scenario (Preferred)**

The preferred bullish scenario suggests a continuing bull market is underway. PRIMARY[5] wave started from the 06-FEB-2019 low, and has completed its first parabolic uptrend labelled as INTERMEDIATE(1) wave at the 26-JUN-2019 high.

INTERMEDIATE(2) wave pullback started at the 26-JUN-2019 high, and retraced an almost Fibonacci 61.8% thus far into the 23-OCT-2019 low. This 4-month decline unfolded in a three wave A-B-C structure. With technical momentum indicators such as the RSI (Relative Strength Index) positively diverging from price action on multiple timeframes, it appears the pullback may be complete. However, the first set of five rising impulsive waves are yet to be discernible from the 23-OCT-2019 low.

—BTC: 

—GBTC: 

Any further extended declines for INTERMEDIATE(2) wave pullback ought to be concluded at the following Fibonacci support zones, using BITSTAMP:

    @7230: 61.8% Fibonacci retracement from 15-DEC-2018 to 26-JUN-2019. [AVG]
    @5425: 78.6% Fibonacci retracement from 15-DEC-2018 to 26-JUN-2019. [MAX]
    @4350: 88.6% Fibonacci retracement from 15-DEC-2018 to 26-JUN-2019. [WARNING: Bull Market Terminated?]

From the 23-OCT-2019 low, the continuing bull market scenario would now suggest the start of a rising INTERMEDIATE(3) wave. Such a wave is expected to unfold parabolically in nature, and at a minimum, meet or exceed the PRIMARY[3] high set on 17-DEC-2017. In both price and time, this wave is expected to be the longest of the PRIMARY[5] bull market. Subdividing and extending parabolic waves on exponential price scales are challenging to track. The maximum declines within INTERMEDIATE(3) wave ought to be around 40% in size, with averages of 20%-25%.

Where the PRIMARY[5] bull market ends is open to interpretation and speculation. 

From an Elliott Wave perspective: A common wave relationship guides the price of the fifth wave to be equal to; or extend a Fibonacci 1.618 times; the length from the low of the first wave through to the high of third wave; projected from the low of the fourth wave. This provides a conservative target of the current bull market to conclude between $22,912 and $35,127, calculated using the BraveNewCoin (BLX) index:

    @22912: PRIMARY[5] = (PRIMARY[1] + PRIMARY[3]) * 1
    @35127: PRIMARY[5] = (PRIMARY[1] + PRIMARY[3]) * 1.618

—BLX: 

As and when the waves develop and progress, and in the event of subdividing and extending waves, revised price targets shall be calculated with renewed projections.

____

**Bear Scenario (Alternative)**

The alternative bear market scenario suggests the 2019 bull market was a short-lived affair, and PRIMARY[5] terminated as a failed-fifth truncated wave at the 26-JUN-2019 high.

In this scenario, five completed PRIMARY degree waves have completed a CYCLE I wave structure. And now a CYCLE II wave bear market pullback is underway and headed to break below the 2018 low.

—BLX: 

The decline from the 26-JUN-2019 high to the 23-OCT-2019 low completed the first leg of the bear market. And now, the first bounce of the bear market may be currently underway retracing towards the following Fibonacci zones, using BITSTAMP prices:

    @9810:  38.2% Fibonacci retracement from 26-JUN-2019 to 23-OCT-2019. [MIN]
    @10590: 50.0% Fibonacci retracement from 26-JUN-2019 to 23-OCT-2019. [AVG]
    @11365: 61.8% Fibonacci retracement from 26-JUN-2019 to 23-OCT-2019. [AVG]
    @12470: 78.6% Fibonacci retracement from 26-JUN-2019 to 23-OCT-2019. [MAX]

Once the bear market bounce completes at any of the aforementioned resistance zones, the next phase of the decline is expected to commence, and break below the 2018 low.

—BTC: 

At this point in time, the alternative bear market scenario may be paused for consideration whilst price action remains above the 23-OCT-2019 low.

The alternative bear market scenario may be gradually phased-out, step-by-step as follows:

1. A rising five wave impulsive structure from the 23-OCT-2019 low.
2. Price advancing beyond the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement from 26-JUN-2019 to 23-OCT-2019.
3. Price exceeding the 26-JUN-2019 high.

BitGive was the very first Bitcoin non-profit recognized by the United States government. They've been around since 2013, so Connie has a valuable and unique view on cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. She's a huge advocate for crypto and blockchain technology, and her company is not only helping people, but helping to encourage adoption.

I typically post my interviews to this subreddit. Hopefully I've followed all rules, and I hope you all gain some valuable insight from this discussion.

Connie joins The BitcoinTaxes Podcast to discuss how blockchain technology is perfect for the non-profit sector. We discuss the benefits of utilizing the blockchain and cryptocurrency for social good, in addition to the added perk of being able to offset crypto capital gains to save you some money come tax time.

**Episode Highlights**

**Non-Profits &amp; The Blockchain – Perfect Harmony (07:20):**

A lot of people, especially in the NGO world, see it as a different and new way to fundraise. That’s what I call the gateway – but there’s so much more to it. First of all, being able to fundraise without borders. You can a fundraise globally without any sort of constraints around regulatory boundaries, in a single currency. Moving it on the blockchain provides huge benefits to reducing the time and cost involved, especially for cross border transactions. Using the Bitcoin Network, you can get the donation there within minutes, and you’re only paying a network fee. It’s tremendously improving upon the current systems.

On top of that, we talk about the transparency of the blockchain itself. If you’re using this network to move funds across borders, then you can actually watch it happening on the blockchain in real time and you can see where those funds go and what’s going on with the them. We’re trying to surface the data in a way that is user friendly, makes sense, and can be used for accountability. NGOs can share what they’ve done with the funds to build trust and have a way to engage more with their donors on a real-time basis.

**Helping Others While Helping Yourself (14:28):**

Most people kind of get that you can have a write off if you make a donation and then that reduces your taxable income. That’s kind of basic. Where I think it gets much more interesting is the offsets aspect. If you donate in cryptocurrency instead of converting it first and then donating it, you’re able to offset any gains that you have.

If people actually think ahead before April, about what kinds of gains they might be looking at, they can preemptively offset those to avoid paying any taxes on them, which is awesome.

You’re making a contribution to nonprofits and helping other people, instead of paying the government.

**Donating Your Crypto Helps Adoption (20:26):**

For a mainstream audience, the interest would be more about what can this technology actually do. It provides faster and cheaper global transfers which means more impact on the ground for the nonprofits. It’s so crucial for us to have real use cases and to be able to demonstrate that those use cases are real and happening currently and not just in theory. We’re able to demonstrate them in ways that are very relevant – like charity.

I have nothing against buying coffee with Bitcoin, but I think it’s not necessarily the most intriguing demonstration of how the technology can benefit and improve existing ways of doing things.

**The Industry Is Evolving (34:05):**

Looking back at where we were in 2013 – with the first ever Bitcoin conference; and now there’s events every day on every continent. We used to work with one charity at a time and now we have a platform with 12 projects.

My hope is that we are able to break through some of these major barriers that are in the way and get to mainstream adoption where we reduce the friction of the on-ramps…and we’re able to really build out a functioning ecosystem. That is where I see it going. I definitely think that that’s possible in 5 or 10 years.",0.011,0.81,0.178,0.9992

From an Elliott Wave perspective, two scenarios are under consideration at this inflection point: a continuing **Bull Scenario** or a **Bear Scenario**.

In either scenario, the Elliott Wave model proposes a five wave structure, consisting of: three advancing bull market waves, interwoven with two declining bear market waves. Overlaying this model onto Bitcoin suggests:

    Wave-1: the first bull market wave 2010-2013 (1219 days), followed by;
    Wave-2: the first bear market wave 2013-2015 (426 days), followed by;
    Wave-3: the second bull market wave 2015-2018 (1065 days), followed by;
    Wave-4: the second bear market wave 2018-2019 (363 days), followed by;
    Wave-5: the third and final bull market wave 2019-?

—BLX: 

The five aforementioned have been considered as PRIMARY degree waves —such waves elapse the course of a few months to a couple of years. Each PRIMARY degree wave is constituted of five INTERMEDIATE degree waves; and in turn, so forth into smaller degree fractals.

The **Bull Scenario** suggests Wave-5 is still underway, with subdividing and extending waves headed for new all-time highs.

The **Bear Scenario** suggests Wave-5 completed at the 26-JUN-2019 high as a truncated fifth wave failure, and a bear market is underway.

____

**Bull Scenario**

The bullish scenario suggests a continuing bull market is underway. PRIMARY[5] wave started from the 06-FEB-2019 low, and has completed its first parabolic uptrend labelled as INTERMEDIATE(1) wave at the 26-JUN-2019 high.

—BTC: 

INTERMEDIATE(2) wave pullback started at the 26-JUN-2019 high, and retraced an almost Fibonacci 61.8% thus far of the 2019 bull market, into the 23-OCT-2019 low.

This 4-month decline had initially appeared to have completed an INTERMEDIATE(2) wave pullback when the market suddenly spiked and surged over 40% within a day —attributed to news of Chinese leader Xi Jinping reportedly stating China should “seize the opportunity” offered by blockchain. The surge was the third largest 24-hour price gain in Bitcoin's history.

However, since the spike high on 26-OCT-2019, the market has steadily sold-off and now returned back to the 23-OCT-2019 low; and hence, erasing the entire late OCT surge. The surge is now being considered as a B-wave as part of an ongoing INTERMEDIATE(2) wave pullback. In hindsight, it ought to have been obvious this Thanksgiving Turkey isn’t cooked yet:

*“B waves are phonies. They are sucker plays, bull traps, speculators' paradise, orgies of odd-lotter mentality or expressions of dumb institutional complacency (or both). They often involve a focus on a narrow list of stocks, are often ‘unconfirmed’ by other averages, are rarely technically strong, and are virtually always doomed to complete retracement by wave C. If the analyst can easily say to himself, ‘There is something wrong with this market,’ chances are it's a B wave.”* —Elliott Wave Principle Key to Market Behavior; A.J. Frost, Robert Prechter.

From the B-wave high set on 26-OCT-2019, C-wave of INTERMEDIATE(2) wave pullback has been underway and is expected to conclude at the following Fibonacci support zones, using BITSTAMP:

    @7230: 61.8% Fibonacci retracement from 15-DEC-2018 to 26-JUN-2019. [AVG]
    @5425: 78.6% Fibonacci retracement from 15-DEC-2018 to 26-JUN-2019. [MAX]
    @4350: 88.6% Fibonacci retracement from 15-DEC-2018 to 26-JUN-2019. [WARNING: Bull Market Terminated?]

In addition to the aforementioned support zones, the following additional midway Fibonacci zones can be sought as support for this current INTERMEDIATE(2) decline, using BITSTAMP:

    @7055: Wave-C = Wave-A * 0.500
    @6280: Wave-C = Wave-A * 0.618
    @5170: Wave-C = Wave-A * 0.786

Summary of support zones, using BITSTAMP:
7230, 7055, 6280, 5425, 5170, 4350

At time of writing, price is currently meandering between the first two aforementioned support levels.

Once INTERMEDIATE(2) wave pullback has completed, a rising INTERMEDIATE(3) is expected to commence to resume the bull market. Such a wave is expected to unfold parabolically in nature, and at a minimum, meet or exceed the PRIMARY[3] high set on 17-DEC-2017. In both price and time, this wave is expected to be the longest of the PRIMARY[5] bull market.

Where the PRIMARY[5] bull market ends is open to interpretation and speculation. 

From an Elliott Wave perspective: A common wave relationship guides the price of the fifth wave to be equal to; or extend a Fibonacci 1.618 or 2.618 times; the length from the low of the first wave through to the high of third wave; projected from the low of the fourth wave. This provides a conservative target of the current bull market to conclude between $22,912 or $35,127 or $54,892, calculated using the BraveNewCoin (BLX) index:

    @22912: PRIMARY[5] = (PRIMARY[1] + PRIMARY[3]) * 1
    @35127: PRIMARY[5] = (PRIMARY[1] + PRIMARY[3]) * 1.618
    @54892: PRIMARY[5] = (PRIMARY[1] + PRIMARY[3]) * 2.618

—BLX: 

As and when the waves develop and progress, and in the event of subdividing and extending waves, revised price targets shall be calculated with renewed projections.

____

**Bear Scenario**

The bear market scenario suggests the 2019 bull market was a short-lived affair, and PRIMARY[5] terminated as a failed-fifth truncated wave.

PRIMARY[5] started from the 15-DEC-2018 low and completed at the 26-JUN-2019 high. A Fibonacci 88.6% retracement of this uptrend is at 4350 BITSTAMP —a decline to this point ought to signal the goose is cooked and market has favoured to deflate. 

—BTC: 

In this scenario, five completed PRIMARY degree waves have completed a CYCLE I wave structure. And now, a CYCLE II wave bear market pullback is underway and headed to break below the 2018 low.

—BLX: 

The wider cryptocurrency market in terms of the Altcoins currently appear to support the outlook of a bear market. So far in 2019, the price structure of majority Altcoins has seemingly unfolded in corrective A-B-C advancing waves, instead of impulsive 1-2-3-4-5 waves. This suggests the majority of Altcoins may be set to break their respective 2018 lows unless an intervention can be coordinated…

11/28/19,"Hi all,

College student here, graduating in may. Currently about half of my money is in a Roth IRA, 40% in TastyWorks for both cash holdings and I trade options heavily, and the last 10% is currently in bitcoin.

Looking to allocate another 10% into bitcoin, but wondering whether this is a bit too risky. I absolutely love the concept of bitcoin and far prefer it as a store of value compared to gold, silver or even bonds. I know it is still a “risky” asset compared to these, while the other 40% of my account could be considered “risky” as well, except for the fact that I’m very disciplined with my options trades. I don’t allocate more than 5% of that account to any trade and almost exclusively use credit spreads with high probability of profit.

I guess my main question is, at what % holding of bitcoin in your account a bit too much given the high degree of price fluctuations? What % do you hold?

Again, I’m very bullish on bitcoin in the long term as a store of value, but the price aspect for me is tough. If i allocated 20% towards it and bitcoin drops to like $3k, that’s a big portion of my liquid assets.

Thanks, any tips much appreciated, and happy thanksgiving!",0.017,0.797,0.187,0.9921
12/15/19,"## Subject: A Martingale based trading strategy

Investopedia: [Forex Trading the Martingale Way]

I know these strategies have been around for centuries, but here's a brief rundown on what I'm fleshing out for 2020.  This isn't likely what most would call a ""[pyramid] but it was the easiest to code in python. It's a variation of DCA with a few modifications.

### UPDATE: It's called ""Martingale"", thx for the tip u/w0lph

The basic concept is buy the dip and sell the spike, but with weighted bands positioned as a pyramids of limit orders.  Once we decide how broad the buy/sell range will be (given 10% in this example), we will position our buys and sells to commit more and more the further into that band we dip.  Basically creating a pyramid.

Something like this

* 1st-Band at 2% below spot.  Buy 0.001 BTC
* 2nd-Band at 4% below spot.  Buy 0.002 BTC
* 3rd-Band at 6% below spot.  Buy 0.003 BTC
* 4th-Band at 8% below spot.  Buy 0.004 BTC
* 5th-Band at 10% below spot.  Buy 0.005 BTC

Here's a more concrete example

### Example data:

* Assume BTC/USD price is $7500
* Assume a holdings of 0.050 BTC at a cost basis of $7600 (bear market)
* Assume I am doing a weekly DCA of $100 to my portfolio
* We will structure buys from 0% to 10% below current spot
* We will structure sells from 0% to 10% above our current cost basis.

So given the the spot of $7500 and a $100 investment to distribute, our bands will be as follows:

#### Buys

* 1st-Band at $7350.  Buy 0.001 BTC
* 2nd-Band at $7200.  Buy 0.002 BTC
* 3rd-Band at $7050.  Buy 0.003 BTC
* 4th-Band at $6900.  Buy 0.004 BTC
* 5th-Band at $6750.  Buy 0.004 BTC

#### Sells

* 1st-Band at $7676.  Sell 0.001 BTC
* 2nd-Band at $7752.  Sell 0.002 BTC
* 3rd-Band at $7828.  Sell 0.003 BTC
* 4th-Band at $7904.  Sell 0.004 BTC
* 5th-Band at $7980.  Sell 0.005 BTC
* 6th-Band at $8056.  Sell 0.005 BTC
* 7th-Band at $8132.  Sell 0.006 BTC
* 8th-Band at $8208.  Sell 0.007 BTC
* 9th-Band at $8284.  Sell 0.008 BTC
* 10th-Band at $8360.  Sell 0.009 BTC

So between $7350 and $7676, nothing happens for the week.  If the price swings outside that HODL band, then I'll start buying if it drops or selling if it spikes.

I have a bit of python to build the bands, but excel could do it as well.  Once you determine how many bands you need, then you just redo them ever week.  Here are the basic rules to do every week to set this up.

1. Every week re-evaluate your cost-basis for how much you have invested in BTC
2. Every week re-evaluate your Sell and Buy bands (I used 10% in the above example)
3. If you had any ""Sells"" trigger from the previous week, add that to your DCA investment
2. Build your ""Sell"" pyramid based on your current cost basis and current holdings
3. Build your ""Buy"" pyramid based on your DCA investment and the current spot price
4. If our current cost basis is below spot, set our ""Sell"" pyramid off the current spot price.
4. Clear all of last weeks limit orders
5. Add all of this weeks limit orders
6. Check back next week

### Conclusion

I actually don't know what this is called, I just stole it from a friend of mine years ago, and I assume he got it from somewhere else as well.  You may choose to take profits off the table, in this example I'm reinvesting.  Let me know if you think there is some things I should add or other ways to improve the ""game"".  Sorry it's so long.

Engaging in tax loss harvesting with your cryptocurrency assets is one of the single most effective ways to reduce your tax bill for the year. It’s no secret that cryptocurrencies are extremely volatile. This and a number of other characteristics make it an unusually effective candidate for tax loss harvesting strategies. This guide outlines what tax loss harvesting is, how you can use it to reduce your bitcoin and crypto tax liability.

## Tax Loss Harvesting - What Is It?

Tax Loss Harvesting is the practice of selling a capital asset at a loss to offset a capital gains tax liability. By realizing or “harvesting” a loss, investors are able to offset taxes on both gains and income. This is a tax reduction strategy commonly used in the world of stocks and securities. 

### An Example

John buys $1,000 of Apple stock and $2,000 of Tesla stock in a given year. While holding these investments, the value of John’s Apple stock rises to $1,500 while Tesla drops to $1,700. John sells all of his Apple stock for $1,500.

#### Without Tax Loss Harvesting

Without harvesting his losses in Tesla stock, John has a $500 capital gain for the year from the sale of his Apple stock. John pays taxes on all $500 of this capital gain.

#### With Tax Loss Harvesting

Rather than continuing to hold his Tesla stock, John can harvest his losses in Tesla by selling before year-end. Capital gains and losses get summed together for the year resulting in either a net gain or loss. John’s net capital gain is now only $200 for the year ($500 - $300). In this scenario, John only pays taxes on $200 of net capital gains rather than $500.

## Tax Loss Harvesting With Cryptocurrencies

Cryptocurrencies are treated as property for tax purposes, exactly the same as stocks. This means that you can also strategically sell/trade crypto to harvest losses and reduce your tax liability. Unlike stocks however, cryptocurrencies have unique characteristics that make them even better candidates for tax loss harvesting. We discuss these below. 

### Wash Sale Rules

A wash sale results when you incur a capital loss, and then buy the same security back within a 30-day window before or after the capital loss is incurred. This rule is designed to prevent investors from taking capital losses in one year and then immediately buying back the stock. The [**IRS specifically states**] that wash sale rules only apply to securities. Cryptocurrencies are property, not securities, as defined by [**IRS guidance**] This means that wash sales rules do not apply to cryptocurrency at this time.

### Volatility

Cryptocurrencies are extremely volatile—more so than traditional assets. This volatility means that investors regularly have opportunities to realize and harvest capital losses. The difficult part for investors is identifying which of their cryptocurrencies in their portfolio have the highest **cost basis** (original purchase price) when compared to the current market price. These are the assets that present the greatest opportunity for tax savings. [**CryptoTrader.Tax**] has a tax loss harvesting tool built into the app that allows users to automatically identify which of their cryptocurrencies present the greatest loss harvesting opportunity.

### An Example

Amy has made $15,000 in capital gains from investing in the stock market this year. Amy has also been investing in cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, XRP, and Ethereum. In December, Amy imports her cryptocurrency transactions into CryptoTrader.Tax and notices that her investments are down over $20,000 for the year. To harvest these losses, Amy trades all of her cryptocurrencies into Litecoin (thus incurring a [**taxable event**] and realizing her losses). Amy’s losses in cryptocurrency complete offset all of her stock market gains, and she’s left with a $5,000 capital loss for the year.

## Net Capital Losses Up to $3,000 Offset Ordinary Income

Whenever total capital gains and losses for the year add up to a negative number, a net capital loss is incurred. If the net capital loss is less than or equal to $3,000 ($1,500 if you are married and filing a separate tax return), then that entire capital loss can be used to offset other types of income—like the income from your job. Net losses exceeding $3,000 are rolled forward to subsequent years.  

## December 31st is the Cutoff - Time is of The Essence!

It is important to keep in mind that the tax year ends on Dec. 31st—even though the filing deadline isn’t until April 15th. This means that you must harvest your losses prior to the end of the year if you want them to impact that year’s taxes. Many investors delay only to realize that they could have saved money on their tax bill if they would have sold or realized losses back in December. By then it’s too late.",0.074,0.793,0.133,0.9931

12/19/19,"So I thought it would be helpful to write this up for everyone. DISCLAIMER - You should still speak with a tax advisor and not treat this as straight tax advice, just information. I am interested in the regulatory side of crypto, so I thought it would be helpful.

Bitcoin and crypto losses can be used to offset other types of capital gains for tax purposes. This guide will discuss how to handle your losses and the important things that you need to keep in mind for your crypto taxes.

## Losses on Crypto and Bitcoin trades offset other capital gains

For tax purposes in the U.S., selling crypto is treated the same as selling any other type of capital asset—stocks, bonds, property etc. This means that you realize a capital gains or capital losses anytime you sell Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency. When you realize a capital gain (you sold your crypto for more than you purchased it for), you owe a tax on the dollar amount of the gain. However, when you sell (or trade) your crypto for less than you purchased it for, you incur a capital loss, and you can use this loss to offset gains from other trades or even a gain from the sale of other property like stocks in your portfolio.  

Unfortunately in the crypto landscape that we are currently experiencing, there are plenty of losses to go around, and it is wise to file these capital losses in order to reduce your taxable income and save you money.

## Net capital losses up to $3,000 can be deducted against other types of income

Whenever your total capital gains and losses for the year add up to a negative number, you incur a [**net capital loss**] If the net capital loss is less than or equal to $3,000 ($1,500 if you are married and filing a separate tax return), then that entire capital loss can be used to offset other types of income—like the income from your job.

If your losses exceed $3,000, then the amount over $3,000 will be rolled forward to the next tax year.  

It's very important to note that **before** being used to offset other types of income, capital losses offset other types of capital gains. This can provide HUGE tax benefits for people who have capital gains in other areas.

## What does this look like in real life?

Let’s go through an example to paint a clear picture.

Let's say you gained $20,000 in the stock market this year (this is a capital gain), and you lost $20,000 trading cryptocurrency. Your loss in crypto would completely offset your 20K stock market gain. Therefore, you would pay no taxes on your stock market activity. If you are at a 25% tax bracket, this form of tax loss harvesting would save you $5,000 in taxes (20,000 \* 0.25).

\*Note, there are many other forms of capital gains that your crypto can offset.

Tax loss harvesting is a common strategy used by investors of all asset classes: crypto, stocks, bonds, real-estate etc. We break down a step-by-step approach detailing how you can harvest your crypto losses for tax savings in our complete blog post here: [**Cryptocurrency Tax Loss Harvesting**]

## What if I have no other forms of capital gains?

In the scenario where you have no other capital gains, your losses simply offset your income up to $3,000.

As an example, let’s say you started 2019 doing really well as a crypto trader. You made $5,000 trading Bitcoin and Ethereum. Once August rolled around and the markets took a turn for the worse, you got hit hard and the value of your portfolio dropped significantly. You ended up selling out of all of your positions and took a $7,000 loss. From here, you would be able to harvest a $2,000 loss for the year. This loss would deduct from your taxable income for the year. Let’s say you made $50,000 on the year in income. With this loss, only $48,000 of that income would be taxable.

## Wash sale rules do not apply to crypto

This is very important for those who want to take advantage of their crypto losses. Like mentioned, a taxable event only occurs when you sell or trade your crypto into another crypto. This means that if you want to take advantage of your losses from 2018, you should sell or trade out of your crypto before Dec. 31st, 2018. By trading into another cryptocurrency, you trigger a taxable event and ""realize"" your losses on paper. You can then file these losses with your tax return. Please consult with a [**qualified tax professional**] regarding these tactics.

Because [**wash sale rules**] do not currently apply to cryptocurrency, you can buy back the crypto you sold to ""harvest"" your losses. This immediate buyback is not allowed in the world of stock trading. This is very helpful for those who want to continue to hold onto their crypto, and this form of tax loss harvesting is a common tactic amongst tax professionals. 

An example - If you bought $2,000 worth of Bitcoin in February of 2018, that investment would now be worth about $600 USD give or take. To take advantage of this loss, you should trade all of that Bitcoin for Ethereum BEFORE Dec 31st and then trade back that same amount. Now you still have your Bitcoin, but you also ""realized"" this $1,400 loss on paper. This loss offsets other gains or income on your tax bill!

**You can trigger a loss on paper by trading into another cryptocurrency, or by selling into FIAT currency. Both are** [**taxable events**] **and allow you to ""realize"" your loss.**

## IRS Form 8949

To get more detailed on [**how to report this crypto on your taxes**] you need to report each trade that you made on the [**IRS form 8949**] Sales and Dispositions of other Capital Assets. For every trade that you made during the year, you list the amount of crypto traded, the price traded at, the date traded, the cost basis for the trade, and the capital gain or loss that occurred. Continue to list every trade from the year on this form and total up the net losses at the bottom.

## What if I made a lot of trades during the year?

A lot of crypto enthusiasts trade quite often. If you haven’t been keeping a record of the dates of your trades, the dollar value amounts that you bought and sold your crypto for, and the capital gains/losses from those trades, this reporting process, and creating your 8949 form can become a huge headache. If this is a scenario that you are faced with (don’t worry we were in the exact same boat), it could be beneficial to leverage cryptocurrency tax software like [**CryptoTrader.Tax**] to automatically create your 8949 for you. All you have to do is import your trades.

Once you have your total capital gains and losses added together on the form 8949, you transfer the total amount onto your [**1040 Schedule D**]

## Wrapping Up

Ideally you are a wizard of a crypto trader, and you won’t have to harvest any losses from your trading activity. However, if you have losses, be sure you are at least taking advantage of them and saving money where you can.",0.077,0.828,0.095,0.956

**Summary:** Bitcoin remains in a bull market with an outlook to exceed the 2017 high. However, a price move below $5000 suggests Bitcoin is in a bear market, with price headed to break below the 2018 lows. The majority of Altcoins favour an extended bear market unless an intervention can be coordinated. The outlook for the stockmarket, in particular the USA, is extremely bullish.

____

From an Elliott Wave perspective, two scenarios are under consideration at this inflection point: a continuing **Bull Scenario** or a **Bear Scenario**.

In either scenario, the Elliott Wave model proposes a five wave structure, consisting of: three advancing bull market waves, interwoven with two declining bear market waves. Overlaying this model onto Bitcoin suggests:

    Wave-1: the first bull market wave 2010-2013 (1219 days), followed by;
    Wave-2: the first bear market wave 2013-2015 (426 days), followed by;
    Wave-3: the second bull market wave 2015-2018 (1065 days), followed by;
    Wave-4: the second bear market wave 2018-2019 (363 days), followed by;
    Wave-5: the third and final bull market wave 2019-?

—BLX: 

The five aforementioned have been considered as PRIMARY degree waves —such waves elapse the course of a few months to a couple of years. Each PRIMARY degree wave is constituted of five INTERMEDIATE degree waves; and in turn, so forth into smaller degree fractals.

The **Bull Scenario** suggests Wave-5 is still underway, with subdividing and extending waves headed for new all-time highs.

The **Bear Scenario** suggests Wave-5 completed at the 26-JUN-2019 high as a truncated fifth wave failure, and a bear market is underway. The majority of Altcoins favour an ongoing bear market.

____

**Bull Scenario**

The bullish scenario suggests a continuing bull market is underway. PRIMARY[5] wave started from the 06-FEB-2019 low, and has completed its first parabolic uptrend labelled as INTERMEDIATE(1) wave at the 26-JUN-2019 high.

—BTC: 

Since the 26-JUN-2019 high, INTERMEDIATE(2) wave pullback has been underway and has thus far declined 55% into the low of 18-DEC-2019.

The structure of INTERMEDIATE(2) wave decline has thus far unfolded as three A-B-C waves of MINOR degree as follows:

—Wave-A decline started at the high of 26-JUN-2019 and completed as a complex structure at the low of 23-OCT-2019.

—Wave-B bounce started at the low of 23-OCT-2019 when the market suddenly spiked and surged over 40% within a day —attributed to news of Chinese leader Xi Jinping reportedly stating China should “seize the opportunity” offered by blockchain. The surge was the third largest 24-hour price gain in Bitcoin's history and a simple structure completed at the high of 26-OCT-2019.

—Wave-C decline has been underway since the high of 26-OCT-2019. At the low of 18-DEC-2019, Wave-C reached a Fibonacci 0.618% of Wave-A in length on notable BITFINEX and COINBASE exchanges; in addition, created positive divergence of price against momentum indicators such as the Relative Strength Index on the daily timeframe.

Given the potential of a completed correction as described in the aforementioned A-B-C decline, the market has arrived at a juncture to consider the end of INTERMEDIATE(2) wave decline at the 18-DEC-2019 low.

To provide any credibility to this consideration, price is required to rise from the 18-DEC-2019 low and exceed the high of 29-NOV-2019. In addition, price Is required to unfold in five impulsive i-ii-iii-iv-v rising waves. Thus far as of Christmas Eve, price has risen in one wave from the 18-DEC-2019 low and is below the 29-NOV-2019 high.

Alternatively, the INTERMEDIATE(2) wave decline is still to further subdivide and extend lower. A decline below the 18-DEC-2019 low confirms an ongoing INTERMEDIATE(2) wave decline. The following Fibonacci-based levels may be sought as support zones to conclude the pullback; using COINBASE pricing:

    @5431: 78.6% Fibonacci retracement of the entire INTERMEDIATE(1) wave from 15-DEC-2018 to 26-JUN-2019.
    @5374: MINOR C = MINOR A * 0.786
    @4358: 88.6% Fibonacci retracement of the entire INTERMEDIATE(1) wave from 15-DEC-2018 to 26-JUN-2019. [WARNING: Bull Market Terminated?]

—BTC: 

Using the Greyscale Bitcoin Fund (GBTC) as a proxy to Bitcoin, the rise from the 18-DEC-2019 low thus far, as of Christmas Eve, appears corrective. Therefore, price action currently favours an ongoing decline:

—GBTC: 

Once INTERMEDIATE(2) wave pullback has completed, a rising INTERMEDIATE(3) is expected to commence and resume the bull market. Such a wave is expected to unfold parabolically in nature, and at a minimum, meet or exceed the PRIMARY[3] high set on 17-DEC-2017. In both price and time, this wave is expected to be the longest of the PRIMARY[5] bull market.

Where the PRIMARY[5] bull market ends is open to interpretation and speculation.

From an Elliott Wave perspective: A common wave relationship guides the price of the fifth wave to be equal to; or extend a Fibonacci 1.618 or 2.618 times; the length from the low of the first wave through to the high of third wave; projected from the low of the fourth wave. This provides a conservative target of the current bull market to conclude between $22,912 or $35,127 or $54,892, calculated using the BraveNewCoin (BLX) index:

    @22912: PRIMARY[5] = (PRIMARY[1] + PRIMARY[3]) * 1
    @35127: PRIMARY[5] = (PRIMARY[1] + PRIMARY[3]) * 1.618
    @54892: PRIMARY[5] = (PRIMARY[1] + PRIMARY[3]) * 2.618

—BLX: 

As and when the waves develop and progress, and in the event of subdividing and extending waves, revised price targets shall be calculated with renewed projections.

____

**Bear Scenario**

The bear market scenario suggests the 2019 bull market was a short-lived affair, and PRIMARY[5] terminated as a failed-fifth truncated wave.

PRIMARY[5] started from the 15-DEC-2018 low and completed at the 26-JUN-2019 high. A Fibonacci 88.6% retracement of this uptrend is at 4350 COINBASE —a decline to this point ought to signal the market has favoured to deflate.

—BTC: 

In this scenario, five completed PRIMARY degree waves have completed a CYCLE I wave structure. And now, a CYCLE II wave bear market pullback is underway and headed to break below the 2018 low.

—BLX: 

The wider cryptocurrency market in terms of the Altcoins currently appear to support the outlook of a bear market. So far in 2019, the price structure of majority Altcoins has seemingly unfolded in corrective A-B-C advancing waves, instead of impulsive 1-2-3-4-5 waves. This suggests the majority of Altcoins may be set to break their respective 2018 lows unless an intervention can be coordinated…

—LTC:

**Stockmarket**

The outlook for the major global equity stockmarkets, in particular the USA, is extremely bullish.

From the 2009 low of the great financial crises, the Dow Jones Industrial Average index has risen in four PRIMARY degree waves, with a fifth and final rising wave underway which began from the low of 2018.

In 2020, the stockmarket will be entering its 11th bull market year since the low of 2009. Fibonacci numbers next in sequence are 13, 21, 34. Therefore, the stockmarket isn’t likely to run into major headwinds until 2022; or until 2030 if the bull market extends to 21 years:

—DJIA (1915-2019) 

—DJIA (2009-2019): 

Since the Brexit vote in 2016, the UK FTSE100 has been directionless. With clarity now emerging on Brexit since the 12-DEC-2019 UK election, the FTSE100 is poised to resume a strong bull market:

Analysis is purely speculative, and projections are indicative of price &amp; structure, not time. Merry Christmas!",0.039,0.917,0.044,0.9201
12/25/19,"

The emotions in the crypto community are in the range from mild boredom on the positive side to apathy and depression on the other extreme. Despite the gloomy background, I believe 2020 will be one of the best years in the history of crypto assets bringing record highs.

Here are the reasons why…

**The broader economy**

We live in extraordinary times. Central banks are determined to avoid a recession at all costs by providing liquidity and cutting rates which creates a speculative investment environment. The low interest rate are pumping the valuations of almost any asset class and are also making money managers climb up the risk ladder in search of a meaningful return. Since government bonds don’t yield anything, investors need to buy corporate debt, the ones who previously bought corporate bonds are now into stocks, the stocks loving investors have moved capital to private equity and venture capital etc.

The FED balance sheet jumped $370 billion since September in a new program which is “not QE”. They also cut the rates 3 times this year fighting against a falling stock market and a “potential global slowdown” due to the trade wars and Brexit. As a result we have fresh all time highs in all major US stock indices.

Germany is hovering around a recession, avoiding it technically with a dismal 0.1% growth in the 3rd quarter of 2019. At the same time the DAX index was only 1.3% short of making a new all time high this month.

Even Greece that was on the verge of dropping out of the eurozone four years ago, managed to issue government debt at a negative rate this year.

The cost for avoiding a recession creates a distortion in the valuation of all assets. How do you value anything when interest rates are negative? For great insights on the topic read Howard Marks’ memo on the [“mysterious” negative interest rates.]

This search for return will drive more people towards riskier asset classes like growth stocks, venture capital and eventually the luring asymmetric bet of crypto assets. ""Risk on"" state of mind is what crypto needs as the whole asset class (even bitcoin) is perceived as very risky.

**US election year**

Trump will do anything to keep the stock market and the economy going in 2020. The argument is short but compelling.

He has been very [vocal] about the new highs and didn’t miss the chance to praise himself for the huge 2019 stock returns. He will likely not do anything that will blow the positive investor sentiment.

This is another tail wind for risk prone investor behaviour in 2020 which will favour crypto assets.

**The halving narrative**

Bitcoin’s block reward halving is scheduled to occur in mid May 2020. It will bring the daily production from 1800 down to 900 coins per day. This will also cut its annual inflation in half to less than 1.8%. While being twice less powerful than the previous having in 2016, this production cut is still going to influence the price. As a self fulfilling prophecy or a supply-demand result, both previous halvings were followed by an upward price spiral that resulted in a bubble and a blow off top. This is relationship is difficult to ignore and if there is a favourable ""risk on” environment in 2020 there is a good chance it will happen again. It may also come faster as investors will try to front run it.

Also, this time we have halving events in the two major forks of bitcoin which did not exist back in 2016 - BCH and BSV. Despite being controversial, they are still among the top 10 largest crypto asset. Their supply cut and potential price rise may help feed the whole “bitcoin halving” narrative and create an upward price spiral for the whole sector.

The latest example of a halving was in litecoin this year and it had a very distinct price effect.

**It’s been a while since the last bubble**

It’s been exactly 2 years after the top of the previous bubble. Most alts are over 90% down from their all time highs. That is a lot of damage  for the speculative investor who came in 2017 and 2018.

Also the lows in most coins were set one year ago and have not been broken down despite prevalent pessimism. This has been a painful environment for anybody looking for a quick buck.

There is also a widespread apathy and pessimism among the crypto community with even hardcore believers changing their forecasts to [mediocre] 2020.

After 2 years and lots of assets down more than 90% from ATH it seems that most of the coins are held by very strong hands. Therefore downward pressure is limited and if it occurs it would be mainly driven by short term speculators.

**Tech development**

The hot word of 2016 was “blockchain”. The whole world got excited about it in 2017. 2019 is the year of DeFi.

In case bitcoin gets close to $20 000 again the “late"" money will flood once again to smaller crypto assets seeking higher returns. If/when bitcoin’s blocks get full and transactions become expensive the old narrative of “bitcoin doesn’t scale” would become valid again and this would spread money to BCH, BSV, ETH and others.

Another potential narrative that exists today is the “decentralised finance”  - exchanges, derivatives, stablecoins, borrowing, lending all that infrastructure got far more sophisticated since the last bubble. Apart from DeFi projects tokens, Ethereum is also poised to be one of the top beneficiaries of this trend as it hosts most of the DeFI activities. However the ""Ethereum doesn’t scale"" narrative is also valid so a lot of money could spill over to the competition in the smart contract space.

It’s been more than 2 years since the scaling problems became obvious and a lot of projects that specialised in that domain are up and running. Others are at the final stages of being launched. What would be a better test than a real world influx of new users and apps that will try to fill the capacity. The process of finding a proper scaling pathway will be pushed forward in case of another bubble.

**Conclusion**

That scenario will change in case of a global recession that brings the “risk off” attitude. Then assets will fall into a negative price spiral and investors will be looking to preserve their capital by fleeing to “safer” assets. Although such a recession is inevitable at some point, it seems that central banks have been very good at avoiding it by kicking the can down the road. If they succeed again in 2020, get ready for an explosive crypto year. However, do not assume this run will be the same as 2017. It depends much on the global economy and investors’ risk appetite and it may be cut off earlier and not result in a full blown bubble like the one from 2017. The sensible investor needs to be cautious and plan for the short run in this environment.",0.092,0.784,0.125,0.9915

**In summarize**, the Bitcoin price is possibly following a fractal from 2014/2015, which suggests that the price is very close to reaching a bottom and a new upward trend will soon follow. The movement prior to the last halvening supports the creation of this fractal.

By all accounts, Bitcoin has had quite a tumultuous year. After starting the year more than 80% down from its all-time high, BTC recovered significantly before once again losing several thousands of dollars in value.  


  

As the halving approaches, many see a strong hashrate as an indicator of strong future price action. Substantial miner activity indicates that few [miners have capitulated] ahead of the reward halving. Such mining activity indicates that block transaction fees are enough to drive miners into the market.

All of this information is ultimately bullish for Bitcoin. The short term price may move in different directions, but the long term curve should be positive.

01/14/20,"Some people have asked about paying taxes on cryptocurrencies and I thought I'd write a post about it. Disclosure:

* This is about US taxes only.
* This is your money - don't let anyone tell you what to do with it and consult a professional - rather than a random person from the Internets.
* My experience is 20 years of trading (and therefore filing taxes). My info comes from tax professionals who file my taxes so take that for what its worth. I'm not a tax person so I hope to get this right.
* the information below should apply to most people here. If you're worth $5 billion, why are you here? This stuff doesn't apply to you.

**Do I even need to pay taxes?**

You only need to pay taxes **if you sell AND make a profit**. If you hold and don't sell, you don't need to pay taxes. If you sell - even if you had that cash for a fraction of a second - you still owe if you made a profit.

IRS treats cryptocurrency as property - *not currency* - and **capital gains taxes** apply. ([Citation]

Pro tip: don't mess with the IRS. If they can get Capone, they can get you. If you're off by $5, they won't care but if you're hiding thousands - they'll come after you, find it, make you pay - 
with penalties and crazy interest rates. It's not worth it. Plus they'll be auditing some accounts and bank accounts with unusual activity. There was an announcement that the [IRS will be asking taxpayers] if you have any crypto income.

**Capital losses**

I'm going to start with this first since it comes into play with capital gains. Capital losses 
is the total amount you lost during the year. If your net activity results in a loss, you have the following benefits:

* you can write off up to $3,000 per year
* you can continue writing it off until the entire amount is expunged. For instance, if you have $9,000 of capital losses, you can use the write-off for 3 years presuming you have no more capital gains or losses.
* If you lost $9k in 2017, claimed $3k in 2017, and you have $3k in gains in 2018, you pay no capital gains taxes and you have another $3k in capital losses for 2019.
* There is no limit to this so if you lost money in the 2008 crash, you can still claim those losses.
* Capital gains in this context applies to stocks and cryptocurrencies. You lose money in stocks and make money in crypto? This is equivalent from a tax perspective.

**Capital gains**

Now the fun part. First of all, you have to remind yourself that the only reason why you're paying taxes is because you earned extra income. Congrats! Now you have to pay the piper. There are two types of capital gains taxes:

* long-term capital gains taxes: when you hold for over a year, and
* short-term capital gains taxes: when you hold for less than a year (obviously)

[Here are long-term capital gains tax rates] and [income tax rates]

* long-term capital gains taxes are taxed as investment income (i.e. last column from the link called ""Other investments"").
* short-term capital gains taxes are taxed as ordinary income

Quick note: are you poor (i.e. single making &lt; $38,600)? If so, what the hell are you doing playing with cryptocurrency! But fine, if you are then you pay no long-term capital gains taxes.

**How to calculate your profit/loss**

There are two typical ways to count it (I'm not going to give you shady advice): FIFO and LIFO.

* FIFO: First In First Out
* LIFO: Last In First Out

Since this post is already long, [here is a link with examples] I use FIFO. As long as you're consistent, you won't have any problems. If you switch between FIFO and LIFO depending on transaction to try to minimize taxes, you *could* get in trouble for tax evasion. Best to be consistent.

You need to create - if you haven't already - a massive spreadsheet of all your transactions and keep it on file for years. Here's what I record:

* purchase date
* type (ex: BTC vs. ETH, etc) - that's just for me for statistical analysis but this is in case IRS asks. For stocks, this would be the ticker of the stock
* coin purchased (full number with all the decimals)
* purchase price (if it was a bunch of partial orders, average out each individual purchase price)
* purchase fee if applicable (add up the partial fees too)
* sell date
* sell price
* sell fee if applicable

Profit formula is simple: (sell price - purchase price) * coin purchased - purchase fee - sell fee. If you sell a portion of your holdings, I'd break up the original purchase in two and track separately.

At the end of the year, add all this up (or just have a running total like me). Add capital losses to this. If the number is greater than zero then you likely owe taxes (depending on your bracket).

**ELI5: progressive taxation**

Lots of people don't quite understand how progressive taxes work - and this applies to ordinary income (not long-term capital gains taxes). Capital gains taxes are a flat percent based on ordinary income. Let's use the following assumptions for an example:

* you're single
* you make $100,000 per year
* you have $25,000 in long-term capital gains
* you have $10,000 in short-term capital gains
* Note: I'm going to ignore all other things that make taxes lower such as state taxes, exemptions, credits, deductions, etc - especially since there's a new tax plan in the system. I'm only focusing on taxes and capital gains. This means the rate you'll pay is going to be even lower.

That said, with the above, you have $110,000 in ""ordinary income"" and $25,000 in long-term capital gains. Long-term capital gains: Your income puts you in the 15% investment tax bracket. $25,000 * 15% = $3,750 in taxes.

Short-term capital gains are more complex since they're progressive and I'll use ""Single"" filter for the example:

* First $9,700 of ordinary income is taxed at 10% = $970
* *Next* $29,774 is taxed at 12% = $3,572.88
* *Next* $44,724 is taxed at 22% = $9,839.28
* $110,000 ordinary income minus $84,200 (top of previous tax bracket) gives us $25,800 which is taxed at 24% = $6,192

Add them up: $20,574.16 total tax which, out of $110,000, is 21.62% tax rate while you're in the 18.7% tax bracket. Adding the long-term capital gains taxes give you:

* $135,000 total income
* $24,324.16 total taxes
* 18.02% tax rate

Again: in reality, you'll pay a lot less in taxes due to deductions, credits, and various other adjustments. This is just the pure rate based on the math above.

I hope this helps and good luck - I hope all of us have had a very good year but don't forget to prepare yourself for tax season.",0.075,0.796,0.13,0.9971

# Bitcoin as a Hedge?

The statistics shed some light on the current all-time highs in the US stock market. While market euphoria remains, a similar decline could leave a generation of investors behind.

Bitcoin followed a similar trajectory, rising briefly to $20,000, only to fall to less than half. Still, many would argue that the first cryptocurrency is a better risk than equities overall. In spite of its volatility, Bitcoin[ can be considered a hedge investment] against just this type of equity loss.

Inflation plays a role in the value of an investment over time. While the Yen has lost value over the past 30 years, Bitcoin is protected from inflation. Even with new coins being minted every day as block generation continues, the coin will forever keep its 21 million hard cap.

Mathematically, it seems that by the way banks manage money that there is always some crisis/stability/crisis cycle. Banks artificially manage markets and intervene all the time for their own interests. Now I wonder if similar control could be exhibited by crypto exchanges. I know they can't just make more currency (in most cases). But what is stopping them from grouping up on the back end with other exchanges to pool large funds together and control the market more?

&gt;If your focus of research is irrelevant to investments or the list above does not satisfy your needs, more sites offer research on different subjects of cryptocurrencies. For educational purposes, [Lopp] provides a variety of thesis papers on Bitcoin. If you’re in compliance or law enforcement, be sure to check [Cipher Trace] or [Chainalysis] for more details. There are many more sites that offer research on Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, and you might be wondering why other websites were not listed above. The top 5 are listed based on three factors, independence, trial, comprehensive relevance. Independency: They are independent and do not seem affiliated with exchanges or digital asset members, and there have been no reports on bias promotions. Trial: They provide free reports or free sample reports for users to read, before making any purchases. Comprehensive Relevance: The quality of content they offer covers all factors that are related to investments and the crypto-market.

Every time **Bitcoin** rises above $10,000, it feels like we’re in the waiting room. Will this be the moment it breaks above its all-time high? Analysts are positive, but we should also be mindful of the fact that Bitcoin has only been above $10,000 for a tiny fraction of its history.

$10,000 is definitely a milestone despite still being a long way away from Bitcoin’s all-time high of $20,000. The leading cryptocurrency has only been above this price point for [170 days since 2009]

If the above isnt possible, is it possible to lookup the 'name' of the whitelisted addresses using the api?  thats how the withdraw api works, 

1. submit a btc address and name it test1

02/22/20,"Before we get started, understand a few things: The ones who determine where trends begin and end are the traders with the deepest pockets. This is because they have the most meaningful impact on the supply/demand balance that causes trend shifts. This isn't a secret cabal that meets up and decides their next move. They are wealthy individuals (or entities) who are all looking at the same charts that you and I are. They are just wealthy traders, and their positions are so large that they **must** trade on longer timeframes in order to make money in  this market. Their accumulation and distribution takes weeks and/or months. While buying and selling for us is an easy task, for them, it's a strategic campaign. They can't just market buy their entire position like we can. 

Markets are in constant search of liquidity. The price will continue to rise until it finds enough supply that demand is completely filled. Eventually the market becomes oversaturated with supply, and this leads to a decrease in price as supply looks for demand. This process occurs on every timeframe.

Now let's interpret bitcoin's price action. You can follow along with this chart: 


Looking back, we see that November 2018 to March 2019 was accumulation. In April 2019, accumulation was over and the mark-up began. Famous trader Mark Minervini talks about looking for stocks that have ""institutional sponsorship"". Stocks that are being accumulated by institutions and get a large ""push"" (buy) to get the move going when they are done. This is pure conjecture, but the April 2nd ""push"" may have been sponsorship by a wealthy trader/entity. Regardless, what actually matters is that joe public was on board to continue the move higher. If we weren't, the sponsorship would have failed, and price would have dropped back into the accumulation range.

The mark-up phase begins. Demand meets the 1st round of supply in the 5k range. Smaller traders take profit (I did, unfortunately). The big guys aren't interested in this area. They didn't accumulate for 5 months just to sell here. They plan on selling much higher. In May, demand increases and price marks-up higher in search of supply. Demand meets the 2nd round of supply in the 7-9k range. A few weeks of distribution to buyers, and demand is still not satisfied. The market wants more bitcoin. In June, price marks-up even higher in search of supply. Demand meets the 3rd round of supply in the 10-14k range. The biggest traders begin unwinding their positions in this range. Like accumulation, distribution will take them weeks/months. They don't care about selling at the exact 13.8k top. There isn't enough demand up there. Large traders don't sell where they want to. They sell where they can - where buyers will show-up and support their distribution. This is the 9.5-11.5k range I've highlighted in red.

Eventually, demand has been completely saturated, and the price breaks down from the distribution range in search of liquidity. Deep pockets begin accumulating again in the 6.5-7.5k range. After a couple months, mark-up begins in January in search of supply once again. Demand meets its 1st round of supply in February. A range is being formed here right now. The question is: will demand in this range be enough to absorb all the supply coming to market, and be enough to search for more at a higher price? 

**My ST analysis:** Looking at the dashed line at 9.6k, you can see price is back in the previous distribution range from late 2019. A weekly close below 9.6k will warn us that supply is overpowering demand. Maintaining above 9.6k will add evidence that this prior resistance (distribution) is turning into support (accumulation), and a push to the next resistance at 11.5k is possible.

I know what some of you are thinking: ""past performance is no guarantee of future results"". I 100% agree. But past performance (price action) certainly influences the buy and sell decisions of the deepest pockets in this market. They don't trade off feelings. They trade off hard data.

In this next chart, I've added the 21-week SMA. Notice how reliably it determines the general trend. It supported the entire 2016-2017 bull run: 



And it (mostly) provided resistance during our bear market.

Notice everything that happened at the red arrow in the chart below. The downtrend line from ATH was broken, price broke above the 21-week SMA, and an ascending triangle chart pattern broke upward. This is called confluence. The more confluence, the stronger and more reliable the signal:



The 21-week SMA also marked the breakdown of the distribution range in Late September 2019. It then served as resistance on the late October spike up to 10k. The market is currently oscillating above and below it. This is the large consolidation stage before, what I believe to be, the sustained bull run that is coming. Eventually, the 21-week SMA will again serve as major bull market support.

**My LT analysis**: A weekly close below the uptrend line that goes back to November 2015, and longterm bullish market structure has seriously broken down. In that case, I would close my positions and wait for clarification. A weekly close above 11.5k and price would be above the ATH downtrend line and the 11.5k resistance line. Disclaimer: My downtrend line from ATH is not a valid trendline. A trendline is defined as 3 touching points. So this line is more speculative than the uptrend line. But I am including it in my analysis because when it aligns with other important levels (such as 11.5k resistance), confluence exists. And that increases the probability the downtrend line will provide resistance and become a valid trendline.


To wrap all of this up, the lines I have on my chart are the ones I believe are most relevant to bitcoin's past and future price action. If you were looking for predictions, sorry, I can't give that to you. But I can do my best to interpret the past and speculate higher probability outcomes based on the market's reaction to those lines.
I hope you guys got some value out of this. I'm happy to receive constructive criticism on my analysis - anything that could improve it.

Any questions about things that need clarification, ask away and I'll do my best.

02/23/20,"##Major Moon Math Update: The Pre Halving Prognostication Update




The halving is coming and just like each preceding halving event bears argue that the halving is priced in while bulls argue that it’s impossible to price in the halving. The pattern repeats itself predictably. If you don’t believe me go back and look at the discussion threads leading up to the last halving. We see the same arguments using the same reasoning today that we saw back then.

Where does Moon Math stand on the controversy? That shouldn’t be hard to predict; both perspectives have important truths to observe. Unwrapping the truths and attaching ourselves to what seems most important is a hard problem, and maybe we can try to figure that out together.



We’re going to unpack that graphic over the course of this post.

Bitcoin’s price moves ahead of itself a little before each halving event and cools off immediately after the price surges. That happens even though eight weeks before the last halving we saw the price almost double in a four week period.  Bulls will be quick to point out that the price still jumped from a low of $430 to a high of $780, but the market showed that the price was unsustainable on the high end of that.



The 2012 halving also showed an unsustainable doubling of the price, from a low of $7.05 to a high of $15.50 8 weeks before the halving. 



Each time bitcoin breaks out like this before the halving we see the price recede back to more rational prices. Then, after the halving, the price rises into a slow multi-year parabolic advance.

To be clear, I do NOT see bitcoin’s price doubling *again* before the halving. That improbable event will take us to a new ATH and performance like that will out pace all previous halving events. It *could* happen, but $20k bitcoin before the third quarter of this year is an extremely low probability event. Instead, I think we’re seeing the impact of a mature and slower market. Instead of the price doubling over a few weeks we see it more than double over a year. Proportionally we’re right where we should be, and $10k bitcoin only seems like a slightly high premium for late market entrances.

The Moon Math narrative is that the price of bitcoin is stabilizing over time. We can see that by measuring the gap between Bollinger bands from week to week. 


BBand width shows us that volatility is trending down, but also that we’re seeing fewer periods of extended price stability. Overall, though, bitcoin is much less volatile in the past. 

We can also see that we’ve been in an extended period of accumulation as measured by “on balance volume”



The market is accumulating bitcoin week over week and the rate of that accumulation is, compared historically, very gradual. We haven’t seen rapid accumulation spikes pre halving, yet. The lack of obscene pre halving accumulation might convince some bulls that the market hasn’t seen what should be a pre halving surge. Those bulls might pause for a minute and observe the impact of leverage and the increased volume we’ve seen over the last several weeks. The pre halving surge is here, but the market might have priced in the “inevitable” surge and crash by way of leveraged short positions. Have short positions stabilized bitcoin’s price performance and prevented what would otherwise be a very irrational pre halving swing? Indeed, the market cannot rationally anticipate the impact of the halving event, but it can smooth out the peaks and valleys that we’ve seen in the past. Again, look at OBV and BBand widths on the weekly chart and try to tell yourself that bitcoin is less stable today than it was 4 or 8 years ago.

Retail’s share of overall market volume has also been increasing steadily.



The story is the same with (green) and without (red) Bitmex. More bitcoins are being purchased on unleveraged markets. Presumably those bitcoins are being held longer term.

On the twelve-hour chart we see a descending broadening wedge.



 

If this pattern confirms we’ll see an irrational pre halving surge, but I don’t think it we’ll see a local high before the halving. 

### The Final prognostication
Cash, stability, volume, fractals, fundamentals, classical charts… everything is pointing to business as usual for the halving, but with less gusto. The price isn’t going to do a lot in 2020 and any substantial breakout will probably be kyboshed by way of shorts on leveraged markets. It’s going to look a lot like past halvings; the price will look and feel flat, which is what our final chart projects. 

Behold, the price projected using the price performance of the last two halvings. The blue line describes what I think will happen:

I actually pulled my buy orders yesterday from the order book yesterday due to the selling pressure in equity markets resulting from Corona.

Some people don't seem to think it's a genuine concern, though I do think buying into the current market is catching knives. The stock market has been inflated over the past year(s) and this may be the catalyst that starts a proper correction.

With an incubation period of up to 27 days, current infected numbers may severely understate actual infections. How many people haven't you come into contact with over the past month? Even if the actual infections turn out on the low side, the current hysteria will severely impact productivity for many companies. (Examples of offices in [SG] and [LDN] already evacuated/quarantined.)

Now I've been talking to our guys in the equity market and they are seeing a pretty big drain on order book liquidity as banks, investors, and trading groups are trying to price in the risk - this is hard as there are almost no examples of impact. It's common knowledge by know that supply lines for China are massively strained, and there will definitely be a roll-on effect in the economy in the near future.

Now, aside from all the doom-and-gloom, I think this does provide an excellent opportunity for market entry for the patient. Initial fear selling is absorbed by aggressive dip buyers and algo's, if a rally doesn't manifest, we'll keep stepping down until market conditions and/or news will improve. However, if market conditions turn grim, [the moment governments/institutions will step in to restore confidence in the market it will likely be in the shape or form of loosening monetary policy as a stimulus] This can already be seen in the [bonus package for HK households.] (HK of course also plagued with protests.)

When this will happen and what shape this will take will be anyone's guess, but as the market is currently very jittery and risk appetite is extremely low, dip buying will probably not pay off. There is no real incentive to assume a rally will take place unless some good news will arise.

Now it is obvious that tendencies prevailed in the global market are mostly negative. And there is a little chance that the situation would change before Chinese manufacture could be active again. Perhaps coronavirus outbreak in Italy has even more tragic consequences for the country's economy, due to the fact that it has started in the most economically active region.

I've wasted countless hours waiting for exchanges to put a transaction on the blockchain, and I've wasted as least as much time waiting for a certain number of confirmations, so I can trade on another exchange where I sent the crypto.

This app simply sends a push notification when the transaction receives one confirmation and then another push notification after a certain number of confirmations that the user specifies. I have lots of ideas for additional types of notifications, but I'd like to hear thoughts from the community on this first version.

I don't know a lot of people that are into crypto, so I'm trying to get some insight on reddit. Thanks in advance!",0.038,0.848,0.114,0.8574
03/04/20,"It is a well-known fact that crypto community has difficult relationships with the government. Each country has its own way to deal with crypto. Let’s take a look at the Indian example.

In 2018 the central bank of India known as the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) decided to ban cryptocurrencies. As a reason the central bank proclaimed the necessity to uphold country’s banking system. That actually led to a discussion of a prison sentence for those who hold cryptocurrencies. Consequently, some exchanges should have stopped their work in the country.

The Internet and Mobile Association of India formed a petition to object the decision to ban cryptocurrencies. 

Luckily, on Wednesday (March,3) the Supreme Court announced that the ban was ‘disproportionate’. It turned out that the Reserve Bank of India lacked jurisdiction to make such a decision without profound research on the subject. Thus, now the main crypto companies are able to resume their work in the country.

It seems, that crypto enthusiasts in India can celebrate! Great case, right?",0.1,0.802,0.098,-0.1007

&gt;Hi guys, I’m doing a research for my university thesis regarding cryptocurrencies. It would be highly appreciated for anyone who spend their time completing or sharing this survey.

03/07/20,"This is a running theory I have been working on for the past couple weeks. Was not sure to share it here as was very afraid how it would be perceived...but I think this could help a lot of people get out at the top. Shout out to TradingShot for getting my mind thinking this way.

# Look at the numbers using the 57.13% Bitcoin Theory…

1. Bitcoin always peaks at **57.13%** higher than its last high in the same bull run *give or take (+/- 5%).*
2. Looking just at the current first half of this bull run, the first peak was $5,642; increase that by **57.13%** and you get $8,865 *(actual was* ***$9,008****)*, increase that by **57.13%** and you get **$13,930** *(actual was* ***$13,796****)*, increase that by **57.13%** and you get **$21,888**.
3. You can also confirm this theory from the last bull run. The first peak was at **$314**. If you apply **57.13%** increase progressively, you get:  


* **Projected Price using 57.13% Theory:** **$495 - $778 - $1,223 - $1,922 - $3,020 - $4,746 - $7,458 - $11,719 - $18,414.**
* **Actual Price Was:** **$495 - $778 - $1,191 - $1,873 - $3,000 - $4,974 - $7,776 - $11,517 - $18,353.**

The last bull run one was an anomaly at **$20,089**. Thinking this was just a pop off the top because of rush of the retail market buying in after **$18,353**.

# Applying the 57.13% Bitcoin Theory to the rest of this run are as follows give or take (+/- 5%):

**Projected: $21,888 - $34,393 - $54,042 - $84,916 - $133,429 $209,657 - $329,434.**

But of course we may not make it through all those stages because buying will exhaust at some point (very important to keep that in mind.)

Using the **57.13% Bitcoin Theory** my safest guess would be the following *give or take (+/- 5%) Please keep in mind dates could be wrong:*

**$21,888 by December 2020**

**$34,393 by February 2021**

**$54,042 by May 2021**

**$84,916 by August 2021**

**$133,429 by October - December 2021**.

This will go right inline with my previous research that Bitcoin will be jumping &amp; dropping 10K levels after the halving this year. Will see this occur in 2021.

03/12/20,"It’s obvious that people use cryptocurrencies all around the world but let’s take a look at the countries which already adopted crypto.

# Germany

Germany is one of the most open to new technologies countries. Cryptocurrency here is a legal tender. Cryptocurrencies are considered to be equal to fiat money. It is allowed to make a purchase with crypto without taxation.

# Estonia

Estonian financial regulators determine cryptocurrency as a ""value represented in digital form"". Cryptocurrencies exchanges can function legally. However, they must be registered and operate under strict governmental control. It is known that Estonia is planning to launch its own cryptocurrency in the future.

# France

In December 2019 Financial Markets Authority of France published new rules regarding the crypto policy. According to these rules cryptocurrency exchanges have an opportunity to get a license in France if they prepare a two-year business plan, a list of digital assets that will be represented on the exchange, a geographic area the service will cover and some other things regarding firm's organization.

# India

In the beginning of 2020 the world witnessed a supreme change in Indian cryptocurrency policy. Exchanges banned in 2018 now can function again, which promises huge opportunities for the country.

# China

Although China is the biggest player in the crypto market, and its government's actions influence the whole industry, this country has a very strict policy. China sees miners as a part of a dark market, thus tends to ban their activity. Nonetheless, China was one of the first countries to announce the launch of sovereign digital currency.

03/15/20,"If BTC/USD on Binance drifts below BTC/USD on Kraken, then an arbitrageur can transfer USD to Binance, buy cheap bitcoin (pushing the price up), transfer that bitcoin to Kraken and sell it (pushing the price down) for a quick profit. Thus, there is a natural mechanism incentivising market participants to keep prices aligned. On Bitmex and other derivatives platforms, this mechanism does not exist. You transfer in bitcoin, then buy or sell contracts, which cannot leave the exchange. It would seem that there is no hard incentive to keep prices in line with spot markets, aside from the general expectation that the prices will align. What am I missing? In theory, couldn't a derivatives market's price of an asset drift away, with no hard incentive for traders to bring it back in line?

(Note: this question is inspired by the fact that an excessive percentage of bitcoin liquidity is on derivatives exchanges rather than spot. This means that if people really want to exit to USD, which they can only do on spot exchanges, then there might not be enough order book liquidity to absorb the sell pressure, creating excessive volatility that would not have occurred if the liquidity had been on spot exchange instead. This may explain part of the flash crash of the last few days.)",0.061,0.847,0.092,0.7964
03/17/20,"Undoubtedly, the first ones to suffer from changing price are individual miners and mining firms. Nowadays the situation has its own peculiarities because of the upcoming Bitcoin halving.

In order to survive halving miners have to upgrade mining equipment. This comes from the necessity to change all the indices, such as hashrate, the consumption and cost of power. Otherwise mining will not be profitable anymore. Thus miners take their time to prepare for the event. Most of them have started around half a year ago. 

Right now the situation is complicated by the downward price trend. This price drop makes it highly unprofitable for a lot of players to stay on the market. There is a possibility that if the price does not change the trend, some of the mining firms will have to shut down. Also if the price goes further down in the nearest weeks, we may see some miners to quit already. First of all, this is going to affect smaller miners who do not have enough facilities to wait out the current situation. However, miners who feel threatened by the circumstances may consolidate. Then we will see a decrease in the number of individual miners and small mining firms.",0.053,0.935,0.012,-0.8627
03/19/20,"On Mar 12 the price of Bitcoin started to crash. After stopping briefly at 5600 the price fell below 3900 on all major fiat exchanges. The magnitude of this movement placed a huge stress on the ability of Bitmex to handle liquidations of losing traders. In theory BitMex will in this situation:
 
Liquidate a position when the account equity is not enough to cover the loss on the position. If the liquidation price is better than the bankruptcy price, the excess goes into the insurance fund. If the liquidation price is worse, the insurance fund covers the difference. If the insurance fund runs out, the winning trader is auto deleveraged.
 
This move was different, the move was so sharp that Bitmex chose to leave liquidations hanging. At one point there was 20m in bids and over 100m in pending long liquidations. Any move to fill these liquidations as designed would risk fully wiping out the insurance fund. Bitmex decides to gamble and protect the insurance fund and the site by not filling liquidations. At this point Bitmex needs the price to pump, yet it is held down by these liquidations. The most amazing possible thing to save the site would be a temporary pause to allow spot to pump and orderbooks to fill. Bitmex gets their miracle as an ‘unplanned cloud physical event’ (later re-classified as a 'DDOS attack on the chat box' occurs). It is impossible to know the exact details behind this action. What is known and that Bitmex agrees to: this event was enormously beneficial (possibly saving the entire site), and trivially within the ability of Bitmex to carry out.
 
Once the site was down the price was able to pump. When the site comes back online, traders who were short are now liquidated based on the mark price (5400) even though the actual orderbooks are trading at (4500). Bitmex is able to create a forced bid (short liquidation) and use this to fill a forced ask (long liquidation) while the insurance fund profits off this entire spread. As the market stabilizes Bitmex continues to send in long liquidations for several hours. The gamble paid off and the insurance fund increases after a catastrophic event, to over 36,000 coins.
 
What does this mean?
 
Bitmex will act to preserve itself when market stress arises. The insurance fund will switch from a theoretical backstop to a speculative trading instrument controlled by Bitmex trading in its own interest. I have always considered Bitmex one of the most trustworthy sites, I have never come across a credible report of them stealing or having weak security. This event however demonstrates that their advertised systems are at the whim of what they feel is needed for the site and their insurance fund will exploit traders as needed in extreme situations.


EDIT

Added a small example here:

Short 10m

Entry Price 10k

Price falls to 100

Profit 9.9m

Coins needed to payout profit, 99,000

Actions during this event strongly suggest the insurance fund in practice is a trading vehicle purely at the discretion of Bitmex. If the price falls too far they have the option to simply shut the site down or pause liquidations to protect their fund, this is effectively what they chose to do. This also sets up a huge boost to the insurance fund when the site comes back and there are simultaneous active long/short liquidations, the engine simply confiscates the gap and puts it into the 'insurance fund'",0.066,0.821,0.114,0.9808
03/19/20,"Crypto-currency is quickly transitioning towards a reclassification as a safe haven asset.  Up until a week ago this seemed unlikely.  Crypto had been highly correlated with equities and their recent price crash from the Coronavirus outbreak.  Recently, however, their price action has taken a completely separate path.  Of course it's a bit preemptive to declare their longstanding correlation over, but I think BTC is actually the best safe haven asset the world has right now.

If you are following the equities markets and the marketplace in general, things are getting very ugly.  The drop from ATH we have seen in the S&amp;P500 vastly outpaces any previous price drop on stock markets, even including the great depression.  Percentage-wise, the S&amp;P500 has dropped 30 percent in a month.   Oil is down over 60% in that same time frame.  Airlines, Hotels, Restaurants, Bars, Cafes are all rapidly moving towards bankruptcy.

Other industries are taking a beating as well.  Almost nobody has been spared, aside from Amazon, grocery stores, and a handful of other companies which are well-situated for this economic environment.  Soon, workers will be laid off across the board, if not already.  Unemployment will spike sharply to levels unimaginable just 2 months ago.  Many people are already jumping past the ""recession"" word and straight to ""depression"".

There is a very real chance that the world's banks and markets will be stress-tested in a way they never have been before.  Governments simply can't afford to bail everyone out.  Many businesses will need to fail.  This will eventually put great pressures on the banks, and anyone who has provided loans to these failing companies.  For the first time in our lifetimes, we are truly at risk of activating our FDIC insurance.  Banks could begin failing and cascading downwards.

It used to be that Gold was the defense against this type of event.  But gold has changed.  Most people who hold Gold are holding it in ETF's, in third party safes, or a safety deposit box.  All of these are feasibly at risk in cascading bankruptcies.  The logistics involved in getting access to your bullion are cumbersome and in many cases infeasible.  Travel has basically halted.  Businesses are closing their doors, if not permanently then temporarily.  They will not unlock them to give you your bullion.

Bitcoin, and crypto-currency in general, is the one asset you truly can control from anywhere.  It has no physical location.  It cannot be repossessed by a failing government.  It can be transferred without permission from any other party.  In the case of a bank collapse, this is the asset that the world will truly desire.  Ask me six months ago and I'd say the fiat system is sound.  That it would not be at risk in our lifetimes.  This black swan event has completely changed the world dynamic, and the economy is simply not designed to handle this type of stress.  Hold onto your Bitcoin folks.",0.108,0.752,0.14,0.9472

## Cons:

1. **Volatility**  
It is impossible to deny that BTC price changes faster and more often than the prices of more traditional assets. It may go away in some time, but nowadays it is as it is.
2. **The requirement of special knowledge**  
To use Bitcoin as well as other cryptocurrencies, it is important to know how to buy, where to buy, how to use, how to sell, etc. These things can hardly be considered common knowledge so far. 

## Pros:

1. **Digital**  
Bitcoin has no borders. It is used equally from any place. 
2. **Good in supporting developing countries**  
Currencies in some countries are even more volatile than Bitcoin. In this case Bitcoin can provide tools to form emergency funds as well as become an alternative method of payment.
3. **No censorship**  
Nobody can interfere in the Bitcoin system and prevent or stimulate some actions.  
 

Probably, Bitcoin needs a little more time to gain trust and stability that is required for more investors could see it as a safe-haven asset.

-	
-	

From the GitHub repository:

&gt;**Theory**
&gt;
Every trade execution by law of Central Limit Order Book logic has both a ""maker"" and a ""taker"" side from orders created.
&gt;
Every ""maker"" order has an event pushed to the ""OrderBook"" websocket stream.
&gt;
The API documentation in all cases of exchanges used indicates real-time pushing of updated data (we did not use streams where there was indication of 1000ms or so delays).
&gt;
So the methodology used throughout is to programmatically watch:  
 - The order book best bid/offer   
 - The raw trade feed     
&gt;
Then look for trades which occur inbetween the bid/ask.
&gt;
This would indicate a trade took place which no one else was able to execute because the trade never appeared on the order book for anyone to be able to see, to then take.
&gt;
It is known that some exchanges are just not good at reporting the orderbook data and trade data in synch, or they do not provide detailed enough information of event timestamp/id to be able to resolve suspicious data.
&gt;
The scripts here compute both Fake Trades Count vs Legit Trades Count, as well as Fake Volume vs. Legit Volume.
&gt;
Feel free to request an exchange you use to be analysed using our methodology and we'll be happy to post it along with results.

Some results (also from the GitHub repository):

[Audio Only]



**Brief Summary:**

This episode's guest is Alex Kugelman. Alex is a tax controversy lawyer with expertise in cryptocurrency and IRS audits. Alex is a frequent guest on this podcast - back in July 2019 he came on the show to discuss the IRS Educational Letters that were being sent out. Before that, in May, he shared some excellent information about IRS cryptocurrency audits. Today, he elaborates on these topics and goes in-depth about what could happen in a potential crypto audit.

Alex provides tips in the case of an IRS CI agent showing up at your door, revisits compliance post-2019 IRS FAQ update, and gives us his take on the effect of COVID-19 in taxes and crypto.



**Some good quotes:**

*""In the past year, what I've seen, the single common element of all IRS criminal investigations relating to cryptocurrency is that there is evidence that there have been sales of cryptocurrency and it cannot be reconciled to the tax return."" (07:10)*

*""I think it's very likely that exchanges are providing information to the government if it's requested, especially U S based exchanges that are trying to be in the good graces of regulators."" (09:44)*



**EPISODE HIGHLIGHTS AND DISCUSSION**

## Don't Under-Estimate Over-Reporting (03:12)

**Alex:** I'm a big believer of over-reporting, which means give as much detail as you possibly can. I think a lot of people get into trouble. They go: “Oh, I reported my transactions”... and you look at the tax return and it's a single line that says “cryptocurrency” and the net number. You have to think through objectively. I've not seen an issue where the IRS has taken a really hard position on lost records as long as you're making reasonable assumptions and using fair market value data.

## A CI Agent's M.O. (10:30)

**Alex:** CI's agents are fairly sophisticated. If they have some information, and they can see these different transfers to different exchanges or wallets - they can piece it together and there's nothing to stop them from going and getting that data at that point as well. That's why I think it's really important that people...try to do the most reasonable good faith effort because it's hard to make a criminal case out of an accounting error. It's much easier to make a criminal case when someone's sold hundreds of thousands of dollars of cryptocurrency and then transferred that fiat into a U S bank account.

## Unmatched Trades and Missing Data (12:16)

**Alex:** The more transactions that you have...with missing information...could lead to more questions. The question becomes where or how did you obtain this cryptocurrency and why is it that you don't have records?

A very common example is Mt. Gox. The exchange goes down, the records go down. That's really common. If that's the story, I wouldn't be worried about it. But, if you were being paid in cryptocurrency for a couple of years, never reported it as income, and now you're selling it - that's more problematic. It could lead to issues down the line.

## CI Agents Paying You A Visit (14:35)

**Alex:** A lot of times when a CI agent shows up it's meant to catch people off guard. If a CI agent is showing up at your door regarding cryptocurrency, it means they already have information that they believe there was a crime and that would lead to a conviction of a crime. So you're not going to explain that away in an hour long conversation in your living room. It's not going to happen. That's not the way it works.

There's always going to be two agents, because one is going to be a witness for this conversation. You just need to remember: decline the interview. There's nothing wrong with that. Get a card and: “my counsel will contact you”. That's it.

The other thing to keep in mind that's really important is that you don't want to start doing things that are new crimes. You don't want to go in and start destroying records or erasing emails. Taking those kinds of steps is only going to make it worse.

## Coronavirus, Audits, and Amended Returns (31:05)

**Alex:** The IRS is, for the most part, shutdown. That means that they're not really issuing new audits right now. It also means that the forced collections, when you owe money to the IRS and they levy your bank account or issue liens - that’s not going on right now. So for clients or for taxpayers who owe the IRS money...if they are currently in an installment agreement with the IRS, then actually they can forego those monthly payments right now.

The IRS is already an underfunded agency, and it was affected by the government shutdown recently. There's really a big backlog to begin with. I mean it's hard to estimate how much this \[virus\] is going to affect the administration of tax compliance. I think it's a great time to amend a tax return or to get into compliance.",0.056,0.887,0.057,-0.5189
05/07/20,"## Bitcoin Halving 2020

In every 210K mined blocks a planned (programmed) event takes place. This event is called halving. It is a regular reduction of miners’ fee (reward) for a produced block. Bitcoin creator put these halvings in software to keep inflation in check. Most commonly one block is being mined in 9 minutes and 20 seconds. According to this, halving occurs every four years. The Bitcoin network had two halvings: first in 2012 and then in 2016. If we look back and remember how much coins miners could earn in the early history of Bitcoin, it was 50 BTC for one block. Later on, after the first halving, the fee was equal to 25 BTC and the same happened four years after, then the reward was cut down to 12.5 BTC. The next (third) halving may be expected in May 2020. The payoff then will be reduced to 6.25 BTC. This will actually continue till there’s no award left (this will approximately happen in 2140).

So why is there a need for halving? If coins are produced very fast or the amount of emitted BTC is not limited, there will be so many Bitcoins in circulation that they will have limited value. Vitalik Buterin once said in his interview with Bitcoin Magazine: «The main reason why this is done is to keep inflation under control.»

## What will happen with BTC price after Bitcoin halving?

Like any other cryptocurrency price prediction, the Bitcoin price prediction is always hard to make, so we can just guess looking at a combination of factors. Opinions are divided as follows: some think that the BTC price will go up and others think nothing will generally change and the price will stay the same.  
There are also skeptics that see the halving as bad luck. They believe that if even 10 percent of miners quit, it might scare away the investors and make them move out their assets. As a result, the Bitcoin price will go down.  
After the first Bitcoin halving the BTC price grew almost two hundredfold, the second time it grew sevenfold. Both times BTC had increased volatility. But no one can guarantee the same events nowadays.  
As far as we can see from the previous halvings, they had the same dynamics: the Bitcoin price grew up. This gives some people hope that it will repeat after the next BTC halving in May 2020.

What are people’s opinions and predictions regarding the next Bitcoin halving? Let’s have a look.



The CEO of Pantera Capital Dan Morehead predicts the rise of BTC after the coming halving: 

&gt;*“It’s right on the trend line, and I think it’s a good shot that by the end of the year, we hit that, and then if you just extrapolate that line out for another year, it’s $122,000 per Bitcoin and in one more year $356,000.”*



Tom Lee from Fundstrat Global Advisors posted a part of the report regarding crypto outlook 2020. Here what is said regarding the BTC price in that report: 

&gt;*“For 2020, we see several positive convergences that enhance the use case and also the economic model for crypto and Bitcoin – thus, we believe Bitcoin and crypto total return should exceed that of 2019. In other words, we see strong probability that Bitcoin gains &gt;100% in 2020.”*



Bobby Lee (co-founder and CEO of BTC China) also expressed his opinion via twit saying: 

&gt;*“After next #BlockRewardHalving in Spring of 2020, new #Bitcoin output will drop again, to just 900 BTC/day. I predict #HashPower will continue to grow, with ever higher amounts of investment in mining (electricity costs). If that amount reaches $54m/day, we‘ll have $BTC at $60k.”*



Jason A. Williams had an “unpopular opinion”: 

&gt;*“Unpopular Opinion – Bitcoin halving in May 2020 won’t do anything to the price. It will be a non-event.”*



John McAfee is insanely positive as usual when speaking about the Bitcoin price prediction: 

&gt;*“When I predicted Bitcoin at $500,000 by the end of 2020, it used a model that predicted $5,000 at the end of 2017. BTC has accelerated much faster than my model assumptions. I now predict Bitcoin at $1 million by the end of 2020. I will still eat my d\*ck if wrong.”*



Paolo Ardoino (Bitfinex &amp; Tether Chief Technology Officer) said the following in his interview to U.Today: 

&gt;*“The halving is expected to occur next year, and I think it’s reasonable to expect an increase in the price of Bitcoin. I won’t do any price predictions myself and this is not financial or other advice from me or from Bitfinex or Tether, but I don’t see any reason for Bitcoin not hitting $100,000 within the next few years. That would already be an amazing goal for such technology.”*



Tone Vays (Financial analyst) is less ambitious. That’s what he thinks: 

&gt;*“Technically, everything is in play until end of 2020, after that sub $5,000 is not likely. Worst Case Scenario: prices drop to $5k into the halving, then after halving 70% of miners shut down due to negative revenue, #Bitcoin spirals down in price but then rises from the dead!”*



Petros Anagnostou, the founder of Crypto Solutions declares: 

&gt;*“My prediction: Bitcoin will reach $12,000 before the end of this year. And will reach a price of $50,000 – $100,000 by the end of 2020.”*



To summarize, the forthcoming BTC halving 2020 will be a kind of guarantee that there will be no inflation, and investments will be profitable. At the same time, it is being one of the key factors responsible for the growth of the Bitcoin price. When it comes to miners, they usually feel stressed about it as to keep their income at the same level they will need to invest in new technical equipment. As for those who don’t mine but just buy Bitcoin to keep BTC as a cryptocurrency investment, the BTC halving will barely have any effect on them.

No one can predict what exactly will happen after the upcoming BTC halving. It is always up to you either be on the optimistic side or be one of the doubters.

I add another $100, the ""entry price"" along with the mark price goes down even further.

1. So basically, what's happening is that as i keep buying bitcoin at lower prices (as the price drops), it adds up all my orders and takes an average ""entry"" price. Is that correct?
2. and if so, then theoretically, if the price drops, can i just keep adding funds to my futures wallet buy more bitcoin bring down the ""entry price"" to more or less the current market price?

05/18/20,"Below are notable difficulty adjustments when hash rate fell and block times become slower for Bitcoin.

1. 26 Mar 2020 \[difficulty adjustment **-15.95%**, avg block time 11min 54secs\]. On the 28th price crashed from $6674 to $6138 ( **-8%**).
2. 8 Nov 2019 \[difficulty adjustment **-7.1%**, avg block time 10min 46secs\]. On the same day price crashed from $9234 to $8783 ( **-4.88%**).
3. The next big adjustment was around Nov to Dec 2018 and there were 3 big adjustments with high block times.

* 19 Dec 2018 \[-9.56%, avg block time 11min 3secs\]
* 3 Dec 2018 \[-15.13%, avg block time 11min 47secs\]
* 17 Nov 2018 \[-7.39%, avg block time 10min 48secs\]
* There was huge drop off starting on 14th Nov all the way to a bottom on 14-15th Dec ($6351 to $3288 around **-48%**).



**Current situation:**

We are 1 day 10 hours from the next difficulty adjustment. Projected difficulty adjustment is -5.61% ([ which could indicate a small dip. However, take note that the date of last adjustment was the 5th and the 3rd halving was on the 11th, between the 5th to the 11th there was increased hashrate from miners trying to mine the final week of 12.5btc that offset the really slow block times after the halving. Therefore it will be the next difficulty adjustment after the one on the 20th that will completely reflect the slower block times after the halving. Currently the median block time taken on the 17th was around 14min (-28.5% difficulty adjustment).

For people who do not understand blockchain, basically with the Bitcoin 3rd halving, mining profitability fell for a lot of miners and they probably turned off their miners therefore the blockchain mining time became considerably slower which is reflected with slow transaction speed and higher fees as seen currently. Bitcoin sellers moving their BTC from wallet to an exchange are faced with slow transaction speed and therefore the sell pressure of BTC fell considerably which will attribute to the current price increase. There is a correlation between sell pressure and blockchain congestion (the size of the correlation is undetermined).

There is going to be a race. A race between BTC price hiking high enough to attract more miners to reduce avg block times versus the closing window of roughly 2 weeks before the next difficulty adjustment. If the price does not jump high enough, the next difficulty adjustment in the first week of June could signal a huge dip.

I am not an expert. I just did some research on the above and wanted to share with fellow Bitcoin compatriots so that we can tread with caution and not lose our shirts. I do not plan to short BTC but I will exit my BTC positions if I expect double digit negative difficulty adjustment in early June.

Please visit the original post here  [

There are pictures in the original post as well as 2nd halving evidence with pics. I could not post pics here. If possible please upvote the original post, a lot of people downvote it. Not sure why people downvote it, maybe veterans attempting to hide information from newcomers to fleece them of their shirt.



Update 1:&gt;! As of writing, I have opened a small short position on Bitcoin. Stop loss around 10k, estimated take profit around 8500. The reason is because the difficulty adjustment in the next 20 hours, even though is just -5% roughly is still significant. I direct you to look into all the difficulty adjustments in the last 2 years and you will know how rare it is. The ones I caught were all listed at the very top of the post. Since it is my first time shorting BTC, I take this as a learning opportunity so that I will have some experience to face the bigger difficulty adjustment in the first week of June. Analysis into execution, even in failure I am happy.!&lt;

Update 2: &gt;!The difficulty adjustment (DA) happened roughly 6 hours ago and the sell pressure from -6% DA did not seem to be affecting the market much. However, please take a look now at the estimation for the next DA. !&lt;

&gt;!On    it is estimated to be -25%.!&lt;

&gt;!On   estimated to be -18%.!&lt;

&gt;!On    the median block time for the last day was 16.8min.!&lt;

&gt;!My original proposition that the true DA of the halving can only be realized in the next DA stands and that it will be considerable. The increased sell pressure from that DA will be highly significant. That is why there is a race by current miners to get the BTC price up high enough to attract more miners to not have the DA drop too much.!&lt;

Update 3: Current BTC price at $9100 ( \~39 hours after DA). Then again BTC could have dropped from all sorts of reason. However the coincidence with the DA and with all the past DA is just too high to simply shrug off as irrelevant. Anyways past result cannot predict future ones, stay safe with the trading. Will no longer check on this post.

China’s WeBank Makes its First Move to Take its Blockchain Global, Partnering with Singapore’s OpenNodes

May 19, 2020

SHARE0

China’s top digital bank WeBank has announced its partnership with Singaporean government-backed OpenNodes. This partnership will allow China’s FISCO BCOS blockchain platform to be brought to Singaporean academics for innovation and new initiatives. FISCO BCOS was deemed to be China’s version of Hyperledger Fabric when it was launched in 2018. 

 

 

The Financial Blockchain Shenzhen Consortium (FISCO) is backed by more than 100 Chinese organizations, including Huawei, Tencent, JD Finance, and WeBank, which is partly backed by Tencent. Developed by FISCO, the enterprise blockchain protocol was the first blockchain to be supported by China’s Blockchain Service Network.

 

WeBank’s executive vice president and Chief Information Officer, Henry Ma said, “We seek to spur the next-generation talents into building viable solutions using blockchain to serve the general public. Providing this open-source technology as a developer arena will also help us strengthen the stack of our technologies in the process while allowing for better products and services for the general public.”

 

This also became the first move in taking FISCO BCOS international, which also support the Blockchain Services Network’s ambition to go global. The partnership aims to introduce Singapore’s university students to FISCO BCOS. Ma added, “Combining forces is the first stepping stone to expanding the consortium into Southeast Asia, and ensures we are well fed by a constant source of knowledge, technology expertise, and domain experience.”

 

As previously reported by Blockchain.News, the digital bank is leading the global banking community in banking technology patents climbing ahead of US giants JP Morgan Chase and Bank of America with 632 filed patents in 2019.

 

China’s international blockchain ambitions

 

China’s Blockchain Services Network (BSN), ChinaChain has been opened since late April for commercial use after six months of internal testing. 

 

The Blockchain Services Network is built by a consortium of China’s biggest corporations including telecommunications companies and banks, connecting nodes in 128 cities in the country. Companies including China Mobile, China UnionPay, and Huobi China have also taken part in the creation of the BSN. The network also includes 7 areas outside of China including Paris, Sydney, San Paulo, Singapore, Tokyo, Johannesburg, and California. This would facilitate the interested parties to conduct business in China to be able to use the network and to follow the network’s rules.

 

Along with WeBank’s FISCO BCOS, Hyperledger Fabric, Ethereum, EOS, ChainSQL, and Baidu’s Xuperchain were also part of the plan to be added to the “ecosystem play,” and “internet environment,” as explained by Zhiguang Shan, the Chairman of the BSN’s Development Association. This network of blockchains will be available for those who are interested to take part in it, including small to medium-sized businesses.

 

OpenNodes: Encouraging engagement in blockchain

 

Tribe Accelerator announced the launch of its digital media and engagement platform, OpenNodes in August 2019. Founded by 25 founding members and led by Tribe Accelerator, OpenNodes is also supported by the Singapore Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA), as well as the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and Temasek. Yi Ming Ng, Managing Director of Tribe added, “All the stakeholders in the ecosystem have come together to collectively drive this blockchain ecosystem for more mass adoption to happen.” OpenNodes allows for more engagement and collaboration between the stakeholders in the blockchain ecosystem, allowing for a better reach of the audience, showcasing the use cases in the blockchain ecosystem.

 

OpenNodes is funded by Singapore’s Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA), along with other government stakeholders, as well as IBM, R3, ConsenSys, Ethereum, BMW, PwC, and Singapore stock exchange (SGX). Its aim is to support and educate corporates and connect them with technology solution providers",0.0,0.885,0.115,0.9956

05/23/20,"Hi guys,

So I have been in the crypto industry since 2017 (like many I guess haha) and back then I was flipping ICOs and moved money around randomly without any clue. But hey, everyone made money back then since coins only could go up.

I experienced the 2018 bear market, cashed out some, I missed out on the early 2019 bull run. During the last year I have been busy teaching about TA. The last few months I am doing quite oke I guess. My strategie is try to recognize a few patterns such as ascending/descending triangles, (inversed) head &amp; shoulders, falling/rising wedges, triangles, bull/bear flags. I am trying to combine those patterns with other indicators like EMA's, support/ resistance zones and RSI. The EMA's I used most are the 20, 50, 100, 200. The only thing I should do is learn to read candle sticks, I am not really good at that yet.

I smh about the fact that I didn't see the December 2018 bottom, because (after all) it was pretty clear that was most likely the bottom. The market was pessimistic, there was a big falling wedge followed up by an ascending triangle, price bounced on 200 MA weekly and ranged between the 200 MA &amp; EMA, RSI was gaining momentum. Ah well, I've learned.

What are your:

\- Most used patterns?  
\- Most favorite indicators?

05/23/20,"About thirty days ago I shared a chart on Price Discovery in this sub. [There was a lot of interest in it and I promised to explain in detail a Bitcoin price discovery algorithm.] I do so in this post.

[*this text post is a slightly shorter version of what I wrote in my blog]


# TL;DR
I applied price discovery algorithms to 5 Min OHLCV data from Bitmex and CME contracts and Bitstamp, Coinbase, HitBTC, Kraken, Poloniex, Binance, and OkEx BTCUSD/BTCUSDT markets from March 2016 to May 2020. Some exciting results I got was:

- Before the 2017/18 bull run, Bitfinex dominated the price discovery process. They started the run. But as the price increased, trades on other exchanges, Binance and Bitstamp played a more dominant role in leading the price up. 

- Since then, CME Contracts and Bitmex contracts have had an increasing role in price discovery. Today Bitmex and CME Contracts play the most substantial role in determining the direction of Bitcoin price. 

- In 2020, market dominance by Bitmex has been negatively correlated with price. Dominance by Bitfinex, Huobi and OkCoin has had high positive correlation with price.

# Introduction
Price discovery is the overall process of setting the price of an asset. Price discovery algorithms identify the leader exchanges whose traders define the price. Two approaches are most famous for use in Price Discovery. Gonzalo and Granger (1995) and Hasbrouck (1995). But they assume random walk, and a common efficient price. I do not feel comfortable assuming random walk and common efficient price in Bitcoin Markets. So I used this little know method by [De Blasis \(2019\)] for this analysis. This work assumes that ""the fastest price to reflect new information releases a price signal to the other slower price series."" I thought this was valid in our market. It uses Markov Chains to measure Price Discovery. Without going into the mathematical details the summary steps used was:

- Data is first grouped into a daily interval. Then inside each daily interval's 5-minute candles, the change in prices between the current time t and previous time t-1 is calculated. The difference across the same time t across all exchanges in a given day is juxtaposed to create an initial matrix.
- The initial matrix is used to create a Transition Matrix, which measures the probability of price changing to something else at time t+1 for its state at t.
- Then other Markov Chain based algorithms are used to measure the influence an exchange at time t had over all other exchanges' price movement at time t+1 individually.
- Reduction and normalization is done to this data. In the end, each exchange receives a single number that sums to 1 for a given day. 

[De Blasis \(2019\)] names this number Price Leadership Share (PLS). High PLS indicates a large role in price discovery. As the sum of the numbers is 1, they can be looked at as a percentage contribution. I recommend reading the [original paper] if you are interested to know more about the mathematical detail.

# Data
[Andersen \(2000\)] argues that 5 Minute window provides the best trade-off between getting enough data and avoiding noise. In one of the first work on Bitcoin's Price Discovery, [Brandvold et al. 2015] had used 5M window. So I obtained 5M OHLCV data using the following sources:

- **Poloniex, Bitfinex, Binance and HitBTC:** Exchange's API through [CCXT]
- **Huobi:** [Official Websocket Market API]
- **Coinbase:** Official API using [cbpro]
- **Kraken, Bitstamp, OkCoin:** I created candles from the trade data obtained from [Bitcoincharts]
- **OkEx:** [Bitdataset API]
- **CME:** Okay, this was was supposed to be tricky and expensive. I broke a TOS and scraped the data for free, removing the expensive part from the equation. I will not go into detail about where I scraped this data.
- **Bitmex:** I got Bitmex data from the [API] 

Futures data are different from other data because multiple futures contract trades at the same time. I formed a single data from the multiple time series by selecting the nearest contract until it was three days from expiration. I used the next contract when the contract was three days from expiration. This approach was advocated by [Booth et al \( 1999 \)]

# Analysis
I can't embed the chart on reddit so open this 

In the figure above, each colored line shows the total influence the exchange had towards the discovery of Bitcoin Price on that day. Its axis is on the left. The black line shows a moving average of the bitcoin price at the close in Bitfinex for comparison. The chart was created by plotting the EMA of price and dominance with a smoothing factor of 0.1. This was done to eliminate the noise. Let's start looking from the beginning. We start with a slight Bitfinex dominance at the start. When the price starts going up, Bitfinex's influence does too. This was the time large Tether printing was attributed to the rise of price by many individuals. But Bitfinex's influence wanes down as the price starts rising (remember that the chart is an exponential moving average. Its a lagging indicator). Afterward, exchanges like Binance and Bitstamp increase their role, and there isn't any single leader in the run. So although Bitfinex may have been responsible for the initial pump trades on other exchanges were responsible for the later rally.

CME contracts were added to our analysis in February 2018. Initially, they don't have much influence. On a similar work [Alexandar and Heck \(2019\)] noted that initially CBOE contracts had more influence. CBOE later delisted Bitcoin futures so I couldn't get that data. Overall, Bitmex and CME contracts have been averaging around 50% of the role in price discovery. To make the dominance clear, look at [this chart] where I add Bitmex Futures and Perp contract's dominance figure to create a single dominance index. There bitmex leads 936 of the total 1334 days (Bitfinex leads 298 days and coinbase and binance get 64 and 6 days). That is a lot. One possible reason for this might be Bitmex's low trading fee. Bitmex has a very generous -0.025% maker fee and price discovery tend to occur primarily in the market with smaller trading costs ([Booth et al, 1999] It may also be because our market is mature. In mature markets, futures lead the price discovery.

                                             Table 1: Days Lead


Out of 1334 days in the analysis, Bitmex futures leads the discovery in 571 days or nearly 43% of the duration. Bitfinex leads for 501 days. Bitfinex's high number is due to its extreme dominance in the early days.

                                   Table 2: Correlation between the close price and Exchange's dominance index

Binance, Huobi, CME, and OkCoin had the most significant correlation with the close price. Bitmex, Coinbase, Bitfinex, and Bitstamp's dominance were negatively correlated. This was very interesting. To know more, I captured a yearwise correlation.

Table 3: Yearwise Correlation between the close price and Exchange's dominance index

Price movement is pretty complicated. If one factor, like a dominant exchange, could explain it, everyone would be making money trading. With this disclaimer out of the way, let us try to make some conclusions. This year Bitfinex, Huobi, and OkEx, Tether based exchanges, discovery power have shown a high correlation with the close price. This means that when the traders there become successful, price rises. When the traders there are failing, Bitmex traders dominate and then the price is falling. I found this interesting as I have been seeing the OkEx whale who has been preceding price rises in this sub.  I leave the interpretation of other past years to the reader.

# Limitations
My analysis does not include market data for other derivative exchanges like Huobi, OkEx, Binance, and Deribit. So, all future market's influence may be going to Bitmex. I did not add their data because they started having an impact recently. A more fair assessment may be to conclude this as the new power of derivative markets instead of attributing it as the power of Bitmex. But Bitmex has dominated futures volume most of the time (until recently). And they brought the concept of perpetual swaps.

# Conclusion
There is a lot in this data. If you are making a trading algo think there is some edge here. Someday I will backtest some trading logic based on this data. Then I will have more info and might write more. But, this analysis was enough for to shift my focus from a Bitfinex based trading algorithm to a [Bitmex based one] It has been giving me good results.

05/24/20,"The halving has caused the transaction fees on both the Bitcoin and the Ethereum network to increase significantly, with Bitcoin recording a growth of 800% in the past 3 months. However, median transaction fees on other major networks, such as Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin SV, XRP, and Litecoin have remained relatively flat during the same period.

BTC and ETH Transaction Fees Continue to Climb

The block reward halving is one of the most monumental events in the Bitcoin ecosystem, with its consequences being debated for months before and after it happens. And while its effects on Bitcoin have been heavily discussed this month, focusing too closely on Bitcoin fails to provide a bigger picture—that the halving has affected Ethereum, too.

According to the latest report from CoinMetrics, the transaction fees on both the Bitcoin and the Ethereum network have skyrocketed after the halving. This came as a surprise as most other metrics on the network, illustrated in the chart below, have remained relatively flat. 

Table showing the 7-day average metrics for the top 5 cryptocurrencies. (Source: CoinMetrics)

Bitcoin and Ethereum See Median Fee Increases of 800% and 250%

On May 14th, two days after the halving, the median transaction fee on the Bitcoin network reached $2.88, the highest it has been since June 2019, CoinMetrics found. Data from Bitinfocharts showed that the average transaction fee on the same day reached as high as $5.1. 

Ethereum also recorded the highest median translation fee since August 2018 on May 14, reaching $0.25. According to Bitinfocharts, the average transaction fee that day increased 30% in 24 hours and hit $0.55 at one point. 

This was most likely a result of both networks having relatively full blocks, the report found, adding that other high-market cap cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Bitcoin SV (BSV), XRP, and Litecoin (LTC) did not record any meaningful increases in transaction fees. 

With block rewards cut to half, the transaction fee was expected to soar as miners suddenly start earning half the revenue from block rewards. Currently, their revenue from fees is a very small percentage of that of block rewards. Ethereum’s fees increase can also be attributed to the increase in the activity of stablecoins, many of which are ERC20 tokens.

05/26/20,"The past few months have been the worst months for many economies around the world since the Great Depression. Dozens of millions have become unemployed, revenues have fallen off a cliff, and there is growing social unrest as different groups address the COVID-19 pandemic in different ways.

Governments, as a result, have been forced to throw trillions of dollars at trying to save every facet of the economy in a way that dramatically boosts Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition.

Governments and central banks have spent $20 trillion on fighting COVID-19

A chart from asset management firm Picton Mahoney and shared by Dan Tapiero, a prominent hedge fund manager and gold and Bitcoin bull, indicates that governments and central banks have spent $20 trillion (normalized in U.S. dollars) fighting the economic impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak.

This is equivalent to the annual GDP of the U.S. and approximately 25 percent of the world’s GDP.

” alt=”Global Monetary and Fiscal Stimulus to Fight Covid-19″ width=”437″ height=”447″ data-lazy-src=” /&gt;Image made by Picton Mahoney, shared by Dan Tapiero.

This stimulus (and what comes next), Tapiero and many others think, will boost Bitcoin dramatically.

Bitcoin could stand to benefit

The world has reached a fork in the road it seems: governments can agree to stop stimulating the economy, which would cause deflation, or they can continue to print trillions of dollars to try and save the economy, which should create inflation.

In both cases, analysts say, Bitcoin benefits.

In a world with inflation, BTC’s absolute scarcity enforced by block reward halvings will likely entice investors to try and secure their wealth in the cryptocurrency. As Tuur Demeester postulated in a recent interview:

“I THINK A PRICE TARGET OF LIKE $50,000 IS NOT INSANE AT ALL, ESPECIALLY GIVEN JUST HOW CRAZY THE MONEY PRINTING IS. I WOULD EVEN SAY BETWEEN $50,000-$100,000.”

This has become such a mainstream narrative that legendary billionaire investor Paul Tudor Jones released a note titled “The Great Monetary Inflation,” in which he said that he would be investing his fund’s capital into Bitcoin (allocation of a few hundred basis points) due to the monetary inflation going on.

In a world with deflation, you could have entire economies start to break down and institutions collapse due to the rising real value of debt. Bitcoin acts as a hedge in case of the collapse of institutions and potentially even governments.

Of course, the boiling down of an ever-changing world economy into two distinct scenarios is a bit of an oversimplification, but the point is that analysts think the current macroeconomic backdrop is perfect for Bitcoin to succeed.

Crypto and blockchain fund BlockTower Capital recently released a research note entitled “Demand is Coming,” in which the firm’s analysts put the current case for Bitcoin best:

The media outlet says that “two sources familiar with the matter” have confirmed the proposals’ authenticity, and the head of the Duma’s financial committee, Anatoly Aksakov, has claimed that the draft amendments are still awaiting consultation.

RBC also quotes Nikita Kulikov, a member of a Duma tech council, as stating that the new rules – if accepted – would only be enforceable if conducted on platforms that are physically based in Russia. This fact, he opined, already rendered the proposed amendments “outdated and inefficient.”

However, the draft amendments do appear to propose some relatively steep measures for crypto trading, mining and exchange-related violations.

They seek to distinguish between cases that involve criminal liability and minor offenses. Under the proposals courts would class the former as being cryptocurrency-related legal violations that “cause major or especially large damage to citizens, organizations or the Russian state.”

Criminal offenses of this sort could be punishable with fines of up to USD 14,000 and up to seven years in prison.

Less severe offenses – such as illegal trading and other crypto-related violations that did not cause “widespread damage” – would incur fines of up to USD 7,000 for ordinary individuals, although public officials could face fines of up to three times that amount.

Companies that break regulations could be forced to close down, and if they are overseas ventures, they might be obliged to leave Russia.

As for miners, the draft legislation states that those making unauthorized use of “equipment located in Russian territory” could face punishment “if this infrastructure is used to transfer digital currency to third parties.”",0.181,0.809,0.01,-0.9956

The Mysterious Entity that Caused the Bitcoin Network fees to Jump 146% in May

May 25, 2020

Bitcoin price has yet again taken a dive to $8,800, recording a drop of 4%.

Meanwhile, Network Demand Score which is a metric incorporating network velocity, transaction value, fees, and miner’s rolling inventory, climbed to 6/6 following the bitcoin halving meaning the network is growing stronger which could also be a sign that “we’re in a longer-term bull market.”

Since March 12th, just before the massive sell-off, this score has remained above a 3/6 reflecting growing strength in network activity and instilling confidence in the ongoing uptrend for the bitcoin price.

3 Reasons why fees skyrocketed

One component of this indicator, bitcoin on-chain fees has been surging like crazy.

Last week, Bitcoin average transaction fee climbed to $7, last seen in February 2018. This has the miner revenues from fees rising to the levels not seen for more than 2 years. But this week, it also dropped 55% to $3.13.

The increase in transaction fees, which is increasingly becoming more important for Bitcoin network security, has been because of the unconfirmed transactions piling on in mempool.

A decline in hash rate following halving caused fewer blocks to be found and will continue until the next difficulty adjustment has been one of the reasons behind this jump in fees.

The other reason is the large fluctuations in bitcoin price which has traders sending coins between exchanges.

Ather reason is a “mysterious entity which has been consolidating outputs at the highest fee rates, driving up fees for everyone,” pointed out Serrrgej Kotliar, CEO Bitrefill.

Who is this “Crazy1o1”?

Over the weekend Kotliar shared how, for the past 14 days, this mysterious entity has consolidated a lower-bound of 720 thousand outputs, 5 MB per day, more than BitMEX.

Since May 1st, this entity named “Crazy1o1” has spent around 804k UTXOs and has paid more than 104BTC in mining fees during this time, noted Laurent.

“On some days, these fees are equivalent to 10-12% of all the fees received by miners,” he said.

Laurent along with others suspect this entity to be the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase.

Earlier this month, it was also found that crypto derivatives exchange BitMEX is making the bitcoin network expensive for everyone and its own users are paying 6.8% of total daily transaction fees.

Prepare for the next bull market

All of this a “decent fire drill for what might happen if we see another bull market,” said Kotliar. Grubles from Blockstream said,

“ON-CHAIN FEES AND BTC PRICE MOVEMENTS CHART. YOU CAN SEE THAT BIG MOVEMENTS RESULT IN PEOPLE RUSHING TO TRANSACT (ALMOST CERTAINLY TO/FROM EXCHANGES), PUSHING FEES UP FOR OTHER NON-TRADER USERS WHO NEED UNCENSORABLE / IRREVERSIBLE TRANSACTIONS.”

The fees reached its all-time high at over $55 during the peak of the bull market in December 2017. As such in the next bull market, a 5x growth in on-chain transactions should be expected.

But given that batching, one of the many ways the network has been scaled is here, it will prevent the pressure on the network from getting worse than 2017. But exchanges will need to be prepared for this.",0.05,0.883,0.066,0.704

05/30/20,"Yesterday, for a few hours, Coinbase historical candles were being written with about +35BTC in volume added to each minute candle, making the chart look very unnatural. This was obviously a bug, and I waited for them to fix it. **This is not about the obvious bug.**

After they fixed whatever was causing the obviously erroneous data, and upon attempting to fix my volume records with data I collect from the websocket feeds, I discovered and verified that Coinbase returns BTC-USD candles in their REST API and UI with significantly more volume than is calculated when summing the volumes from every match order coming over their websocket (and you can use their sequence numbers to verify that you have not missed any), and this has been going on for AT LEAST 4 months, and possibly much longer. This is trivial to test, because a non-negligible percentage of 1-min candles on Coinbase (almost 20% during slow months!) do not have a single trade. Go online late at night on a weekend during a low volume period and record the websocket, and you will see plenty of examples of this. However, ALL 1-min candles returned via their API show non-zero volume while the system was online, which is fake news.

One possible explanation is that Coinbase is adding their main platform volume onto their exchange candles after-the-fact to dishonestly boost their volume numbers.

However, I think this is pure, intentional fraud. Even if the Coinbase platform has 100x the activity of the exchange, it is extremely unlikely that there would not be a single minute without any trade volume for the entire months that I queried their API. Furthermore, the blatantly false volume seen yesterday for a few hours could be explained as their fake volume printing mechanism going haywire. Where they fucked up with their fake distribution is they made the probability of adding 0 volume 0, whereas in reality there are a lot of empty minutes in a real dataset. Otherwise it's very convincing and I would have suspected my websocket code was broken.

Example of real (collected via websocket with negligible missed sequence numbers) vs. fake (queried from the Coinbase REST API -- you can do it, too) 1-minute candle volume (in USD) from January and February.

05/30/20,"The recent announcement that Goldman Sachs would be holding an investor conference call event to further discuss inflation, gold and Bitcoin had captured the attention of the entire cryptocurrency industry. The investment bank called investors to discuss the “US Economic Outlook &amp; Implications of Current Policies for Inflation, Gold, And Bitcoin”.

The meeting took place yesterday, on May 27, and while there were no specific details concerning the exact content and agenda prior to the conference, most believed the news of the call to be a positive sign for Bitcoin, and that Goldman Sach’s would officially declare the cryptocurrency to be a safe hedge asset against monetary inflation.

However, according to a leaked PowerPoint slide from the May 27 call, it is clear that Goldman Sach’s does not have a positive view of Bitcoin and the slide even seemed overly discouraging.
What about Crypto-Spring?
Despite recent Billionaire investor sentiment and the news of the coming fourth cycle of Bitcoin and the ensuing crypto-spring, Goldman Sach’s has made their positions clear. The investment giant states that Bitcoin and othercryptocurrencies are “not a suitable investment” for their clients and “does not constitute a viable investment” as a hedge asset. 

This news came as a surprise considering that in a recent interview, CEO of Goldman Sachs, David Solomon revealed that Goldman Sach’s may even follow the footsteps of its competitor JPMorgan Chase in launching its own crypto coin.

Solomon further said that the bank has been performing extensive research on stablecoins and asset tokenization. In the interview, the Goldman CEO expressed his belief in the potential that cryptocurrency holds in enabling frictionless and quick cross-border payments. He said that banks must remain innovative, otherwise, they will disappear.

For now, it appears the Goldman Sach’s US Outlook call was not the boost to Bitcoin the crypto-community was hoping for, but there are still very positive signs that cryptocurrency investment is reaching a new level with the endorsement of several high profile investors like billionaire’s Paul Tudor Jones, Tim Draper, and Stan Druckermiller.

Alexis Ohanian, the co-founder of Reddit and early investor inCoinbase, commented on the Billionaire’s joining the crypto fray, he said, “It’s interesting to see OGs of Wall Street now getting into crypto and Bitcoin, it’s increasingly showing that it’s here to stay.”",0.021,0.884,0.095,0.9785

06/03/20,"The traditional finance world has long been skeptical of the crypto market, with many financial “gurus” and banks criticizing the nascent market, frequently leaning against age-old talking points for why Bitcoin is bad.

It appears that this is starting to shift, however, as JPMorgan has recently taken some actions that appear to show that they are changing their outlook towards the market.

This trend doesn’t mark any sort of shift in how the entire banking industry views the market, however, as JPMorgan’s fellow banking giant Goldman Sachs recently offered scathing remarks about Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

It is possible that JPMorgan will gain a valuable edge over its competitors due to its gradual acceptance of digital assets.

JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs take conflicting approaches to crypto 

Earlier this week, the crypto market was taken aback by Goldman Sachs’ comments on Bitcoin that were made during a call with clients.

In leaked slides from their presentation, they offered a host of reasons why Bitcoin and crypto in general should not be considered a viable investment by investors.

CryptoSlate reported on the comments made within this call last week, in which the bank said:

“WE DON’T RECOMMEND GOLD ON A STRATEGIC OR TACTICAL BASIS FOR CLIENTS’ INVESTMENT PORTFOLIOS. WE DON’T RECOMMEND BITCOIN ON A STRATEGIC OR TACTICAL BASIS … EVEN THOUGH ITS VOLATILITY MIGHT LEND ITSELF TO MOMENTUM-ORIENTED TRADERS.
This is a sharp contrast to recent actions undertaken by JPMorgan – arguably Goldman Sachs’ primary competitor – who recently began extending banking services to companies within the crypto industry.

The first two companies to be extended service were Coinbase and Gemini – two of the world’s most prominent cryptocurrency exchanges.

This news led Galaxy Digital’s Michael Novogratz to note that this is emblematic of their acceptance of the crypto industry.

“THE JPM ANNOUNCEMENT THAT THEY WILL PROVIDE BANKING SERVICES TO COINBASE AND GEMINI IS…RECOGNITION THAT THE FUTURE WILL INCLUDE CRYPTO CURRENCIES, DIGITAL ASSETS, AND BLOCKCHAIN BASED SYSTEMS.”

This may offer JPMorgan a serious edge over their competition 

Because the crypto industry is so small presently and has significant room for growth, JPMorgan offering services to major industry players could ultimately provide them with a serious edge over their competition.

As the industry grows in the years and decades ahead, JPMorgan will likely have first dibs on helping lead some crypto industry unicorns onto the public markets.

This will help them cement their position within the industry, also leading their revenues to rocket – should the rapidly maturing industry continue to grow.",0.041,0.879,0.08,0.9523

06/04/20,"China is tapping into the potential of blockchain technology like none other; the country’s entrepreneurs and local governments alike have already started implementing blockchain-based projects while most of the globe grapples with legality issues. 


China looks to blockchain

In the latest push, the China Merchants Port announced last week its implementation of blockchain technology in upcoming projects. Partners include Alibaba, one of the largest and most prominent companies in China. 

The “Ant” blockchain, owned by Ant Financial, will bring smart contract-based frameworks to ports in Hong Kong, Beijing, Shenzhen, and Hangzhou, ensuring a “contactless” process to prevent no contracts or shipping date can be tampered with. 

As per a local report, the three firms look to transform China Merchants Port into the world’s largest blockchain-based “digital port,” one that allows open collaboration between participants and promotes verifiability in an industry notorious for large amounts of paperwork and delays. 

A new logistics and finance division will be set up jointly by the three firms, mainly to address the legal, financial, and supply chain aspects of the upcoming project. The trio will reconstruct the payment methods for industry participants and customers as well, using Ant’s blockchain to do so. 

Jing Xiandong, chairman of Ant Group, stated the project is “a milestone” in the eventual “digital upgrade” of Chinese ports. He added: “Blockchain will be the key infrastructure to reshape international trade and logistics. International trade involves many collaborators such as buyers, sellers, logistics, customs, taxation, bank insurance, etc.”

Here’s what it means for China

The development comes at a crucial time for China’s shipping industry; one ravaged by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and battling anti-trust sentiments from global leaders. Using a blockchain system, the country’s ports make data verifiable and available to all participants around the world, increasing trust and introducing collaboration between parties. 

The global logistics industry is infamous for being a tough sector to operate in. However, with a blockchain-based system, collaborators like buyers, sellers, customs officials, and taxation regulators promote multi-party collaboration on a singular platform. 

Meanwhile, other countries are also looking to integrate blockchain technology in the shipping industry. Last week, as Blockchain.News reported, India’s largest port operation partnered with the country’s Adani group. The move sought similar results like China’s, hoping to improve verifiability and tracking capabilities, building a public blockchain for all participants, and penalizing “bad actors” operating in the market",0.021,0.891,0.088,0.9738

Just this week, many were calling this $10,000 to be the last test and that the flagship cryptocurrency won’t move below it again. The very next day bitcoin crashed almost 10% to $9,150 and $8,600 on BitMEX and we are now back to testing the important $10,000 level.

Another such incident was seen this week, when Galaxy Digital CEO Michael Novogratz bet dinner on bitcoin’s next move to be higher to Arthur Hayes, BitMEX co-founder and CEO after he asked “Which way we gonna go?” while BTC/USD was trading at $9,800, up 2.31%.

Less than 24 hours later, bitcoin is trading at $9,690, down 0.44% with the ‘real’ volume of just $1.7 billion.

CNBC’s bitcoin calls have been famously known for eliciting such behavior in bitcoin and worked as a contra indicator to its price movement.

Nothing is more bullish

Bitcoin might be moving downwards today which has some people panicking but it is an “important technical step for BTC,” said analyst Rekt Capital.

“PRICE IS TRYING TO RETEST $9650 AS SUPPORT. FOR MOST OF MAY – BITCOIN HAS FAILED TO DO SO. HERE’S THE 5TH TRY THIS MONTH.”

Market analyst Benjamin Blunts is also feeling “pretty bullish” with the “continual SR flips that keep getting bought back up in one 15 minute candle.”

This is him going long on BTC but he also cautioned that if the cryptocurrency dumps now, it “will be filthy.”

Another bullish call is made by trader The Cryptomist who points out how each bitcoin dump is being bought quickly is a bullish sign and should the ascending triangle break up as it normally does, we could even get to see $11,000.

Interestingly, the market sentiment is currently of fear based on the S2F model value, which might mean it is an opportunity to be greedy.

Not to mention, the bitcoin network continues to grow.

The daily active addresses of bitcoin, unique addresses transacting on the network, are now getting close to a six-month high of 1.01 million.

Another dose of bullishness is the “beginning of the end for govt bonds as a functioning productive asset class.” And according to Dan Tapiero, nothing is more bullish for bitcoin or gold.

Interestingly, in the week of April 27 to May 3, the US bond fund market saw a record inflow of $22.5 billion, the highest since 2007, as investors shift out of safer options to riskier long-term options.

Bitcoin spikes in Russia

A study by Russia’s RBC on June 4 noted Bitcoin trading and exchange volumes are surging across the country’s local exchanges. Most volume seems to have increased from March onwards – around the same time when COVID intensified. The report comes even as Russia considers banning the issuance and trading of cryptocurrencies in the country. 

Officials from the Russian chapter of Binance, Garantex, and EXMO shared insights with the Russian publication, confirming the growth in users originating from the country. All the bourses have mandatory KYC policies in place, meaning the reported figures are accurate. 

As the users have grown, so have volumes. Gleb Kostarev from Binance Russia reveals registrations in April 2020 were about twice those of December 2019. He further noted: “It is worth noting separately that the popularity of futures trading is growing among Russians.”

Kostareb added trading volumes of Bitcoin and other crypto-products, in May, were double of March and almost “five times as high” as recorded in January. 

However, Garantex’s Sergey Mendelev said the increase in activity did not necessarily mean people were actively withdrawing the any profits or their initial assets. Meanwhile, EXMO’s Sergey Zhdanov stated user activity on the exchange’s site increased over 20 percent, with 12 percent of that metric being Russian users. 

The ongoing coronavirus pandemic has led to self-isolated and a lack of income for many people. With such a backdrop, analysts believe traders and new investors are being driven to cryptocurrency and traditional markets in the search of volatility, and in turn, profits.  A report by Bloomberg earlier this week noted an increase in Bitcoin trading activity alongside a decrease in volatility compared to traditional markets. 

The report singled out Bitcoin as a “safe hedge” comparable to gold and claimed the general population is both aware and affected by incandescent money printing by global governments – which economists believe can lead to eventual inflation.

The report went on to suggest Bitcoin prices reaching over $20,000 in 2020, although such predictions have proven false in the past. Meanwhile, Virgin Galactic CEO Chamath Paliyapitaya does not believe the corona will prove a bullish factor for Bitcoin, stating the notion is “idiotic.”",0.016,0.901,0.083,0.9678

06/09/20,"Mark Cuban, a billionaire entrepreneur, famous for his role as an investor on Shark Tank TV show where aspiring entrepreneurs pitch their business models, has watered down his Bitcoin critics as he views it as a store of value.

Complimenting Bitcoin

During a conversation with Preston Pysh, a bitcoin believer and co-founder of the Investor’s Podcast Network, Cuban tweeted that Bitcoin can be a store of value. Still, it has not yet proven that it can replace the present financial system.

This response by Cuban marks a remarkable change in the billionaire’s attitude towards Bitcoin, when compared to a response he made late last year after being asked why he was not a crypto supporter. 

He stipulated, “I’d rather have bananas. I can eat bananas. Crypto, not so much. Look, I can make a great argument for blockchain. There’s a lot of applications, and they’ll be used. But you don’t need public Bitcoin, BTC. You can create blockchain on your own without using all the available cryptocurrencies.”

Cuban’s view about Bitcoin being a store of value comes at a time when a recent survey revealed that 60% of Bitcoin supply has not moved in the past year. The on-chain analysis company noted that this trend illustrated investor’s hodling behaviour as the leading cryptocurrency is regarded as a store of value.

Bitcoin making airwaves

Cuban’s sentiments show the way Bitcoin is no longer an asset that is in oblivion in the eyes of many investors.

 Moreover, analysis from leading companies like Bloomberg suggests that Bitcoin price could surge past $20,000 this year, by doubling an all-time high of $14,000 recorded last year. It further indicated that adoption was the key metric as the much-anticipated Bitcoin halving event took place on May 11, and mining rewards were slashed from 12.5 BTC to 6.25 BTC. ",0.032,0.872,0.097,0.9638

I cashed out of a coin I was in for a while for a small profit of about 1000$ ... then I jumped into another coin which started to tank today so I cashed out at a loss of 1000$ fearing I would be sitting at a loss for a while n having that money tied up .... and now I’m left with my cash (less my $1000) and both coins I cashed out of are now up and I’m sitting here waiting for a re entry point n upset at myself... any tips for me being slightly new to this so I don’t fuck myself again... thx in advance,0.147,0.807,0.046,-0.8928

06/24/20,"Many exchanges were designed to encourage users to trade as frequently as possible, often with money they don’t have, and resembled casinos more than responsible trading platforms, said Joel Edgerton, chief operating officer at bitFlyer U.S.

“There are too many exchanges that are run like casinos and exploit their customers,” he said.

Edgerton spoke to CoinDesk just over a week after a 20-year-old student, Alexander Kearns, killed himself after falsely believing he had got himself into more than $700,000-worth of debt by trading complex options contracts on Robinhood – an app-based trading platform with a young, retail-oriented following.

It later came to light that the negative balance was a temporary phase in between contract execution – i.e. Kearns wasn’t actually in the red. But Robinhood has come under heavy criticism for allowing amateur traders to access such complex instruments without safeguards to avoid confusion and, in this case, tragedy.

Late last week, Robinhood announced a $250,000 donation to the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention and vowed to add safeguards to its platform, such as tightening eligibility requirements for complex options trades.

While Binance’s CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao said in response last week that his exchange already implemented a “Responsible Trading” feature, Edgerton, a former head of operations at the insurance arm of French bank BNP Paribas, said the exchange was trying to shield itself from further criticism.

“I would say CZ’s response was mercenary. He is using a kid’s death to pitch his company and Binance is actually part of the problem,” he explained. The platform gets users hooked and their anti-addiction policy “highlights the fact that they built the product to be addictive,” he said.

Tweet: 

Any crypto exchange that offered 125x leverage indiscriminately – which Binance began offering in October – isn’t serious about customer protection, Edgerton continued. BitFlyer, which opened a U.S. office in 2017, says it already restricts access to leverage and can flag or even ban users that display troubling trading patterns. The Tokyo-based exchange ranks ninth globally, according to CoinGecko, and is the market leader in Japan.

It was reported last summer a Chinese bitcoin trader killed himself after a 100x position on derivatives exchange BitMEX was liquidated, a loss of about $16.4 million in a single trade. Around the same time, an anonymous student trader said he was having suicidal thoughts after losing thousands of dollars on several leveraged trades on the same platform.

Arthur Hayes, BitMEX’s CEO, has previously defended his business, arguing that in a free market, customers can always move onto other platforms if they worry about being exploited or defrauded.

When contacted by CoinDesk, Binance declined to comment. BitMEX hadn’t responded to a similar request by press time.

Cryptocurrency exchanges have more of a role to play in customer protection, Edgerton said. Regulators worldwide cap leverage for retail investors, both in crypto and in traditional assets, such as equities. Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) halved maximum leverage down to two times the value of the deposit this year.

As such, there’s no reason an exchange should offer 100x leverage on top of highly volatile assets without first checking whether the investor knows what they are doing and that they have the income to cover that level of exposure, argued Edgerton.

“We have a responsibility to provide products that are suitable to our clients,” he added. The Robinhood suicide “is what happens when companies focus on tech and profits rather than doing the right thing for their customers.”

07/12/20,"I am a Forex and Futures trader and I would like to get involved with trading bitcoin on the weekend when those markets are closed.  It seems to me there isn't a good way to trade bitcoin.  Coinbase seems to be the most reliable in that you are trading with actual fiat currency, but you can't short sell which is a huge problem for my strategy.  You see, I don't actually believe in all of the hype of this market like 90% of other traders.  Instead, I have a concrete trading strategy that makes me over 200% every month that scales well with the more capital that I have.  Not being able to use more than 3 x leverage is a huge let down, as it means I have to put in more capital.  Forex allows me to trade 50x leverage.  That means I can actually day trade starting with only a few thousand.  Also with forex you can trade both sides of the market.  Coinbase you can only go long and thats it.

I know about bitmex but its not regulated and you basically lose all of your money if they catch you from a restricted country.  Not to mention, I don't like the idea of trading bitcoin..... with Bitcoin.

07/16/20,"Interest in Bitcoin is increasing globally. More and more people are willing to participate in Bitcoin trading and mining. However, Bitcoin history shows that it is not always as safe as we would like it to be. Let’s take a look at some major Bitcoin hacks.

## Allinvain

Allinvain is a nickname of a user on BitcoinTalk forums. Basically, he was the first one to experience a major Bitcoin loss. He lost 25,000 bitcoins, all together it was worth around $500,000. The user believed that someone hacked into his computer to steal BTC. 

## Mt Gox

Shortly after Allinvain’s case, the next hack attempt happened. Mt Gox was one of the biggest exchanges that provided a trade between Bitcoin and fiat money. Hackers compromised its website and started to sell Bitcoins. Their actions made the price go down dramatically. However, attackers did not pay attention to the $1000 limit Mt Gox had. Nonetheless, that hack attack had an important influence on BTC.

## Other exchanges

Exchanges are being attacked by hackers quite often. 

In 2012 Bitfloor suffered a terrible attack and lost 24,000 BTC (around $250,000). Unfortunately, this exchange was not able to survive the attack and was closed in 2013.

In 2015 Bitstamp exchange was hacked. It lost approximately 19,000 BTC (around $5 million). 

In 2016 Bitfinex also lost 120,000 BTC (around $77 million) to hackers.

## Twitter hack

The last attack happened in one of the biggest social nets. Twitter became a part of the latest attackers’ actions. The most significant and world-famous accounts promoted Bitcoin scam for several hours.

## Anti-hack protection

The most important question is how to protect your Bitcoin savings from upcoming attacks. Here are some basic things that may help you to be safe:

* **Use trustworthy antivirus software**
* **Choose your exchange service wisely**  
Make sure that it is properly registered and has a policy for emergency situations.
* **Be careful when choosing a Bitcoin wallet**   
There are lots of options to choose from now. Check the history of the service, make sure it suits your purposes.
* **Use different wallets**  
Avoid putting all your savings in one place. 
* **Keep your private keys safe**  
It is important to remember that the loss of private keys will lead to the loss of coins.
* **Use a multifactor authentication**   
Multifactor authentication links your account to your mobile phone.
* **Do not believe in easy money**  
We all should remember that “there's no such thing as a free lunch” but there are a lot of impersonators &amp; scammers.

Even though there is no way to be a hundred percent safe, there are a lot of steps we can take to avoid unfortunate losses. Cryptocurrency services are improving their protection systems all the time, and we all should do what we can to make this network more secure.",0.132,0.8,0.068,-0.9787

07/28/20,"On July 27 crypto world witnessed a beginning of a new bull run for Bitcoin after quite long stagnation. That day the price of BTC reached a six-month high. Analytics find several reasons for a sudden move.

First of all, the latest changes in the world's crypto legislation added more investors to this market. The previous increase in investment institutions led to a short-time decrease in liquidity. It seems that this time Bitcoin is following the same scheme.

Moreover, financial institutions that go into Bitcoin give more confidence to smaller investors that may follow their steps.

Also, this growth may signify the increasing stability in Bitcoin infrastructure, which means better capacities of the network.

09/29/20,"What is the value of [Bitcoin] It’s a question that’s been asked since the innovative asset first appeared on message boards, and it’s only persisted as its value and usage has grown. 

But while one definitive answer to this question remains elusive, that doesn’t mean it’s not worth exploring. In fact, examining this question in all of the many ways it can be answered can help savvy investors and traders clarify their own notions of value.

In a new report entitled “[Bitcoin &amp; Intrinsic Value] Kraken Intelligence, our team of analysts, attempts to provide just this perspective, summarizing where believers and skeptics stand in the debate and analyzing how different definitions of value might be extended to bitcoin.

In the report, we examine the value of Bitcoin through all of its potential lenses, including: 

* **Stock and Bonds** – Some of the most widely owned assets, stocks and bonds are considered valuable as they offer access to cash flow. But how does Bitcoin have value without its own stream of value? And what is a Bitcoin owner entitled to in a world where anyone can fork its open-source code? We explore these questions and more.
* **Intangible Assets** – With other investing opportunities, one may benefit from asking, what makes this opportunity unique? In the case of Bitcoin, we explore how its inherent properties like computational security, immutability and censorship-resistance may help solve the question of what makes it valuable.
* **Commodities** – Bitcoin may lay claim to a position as a digital gold, but what of its claim as a digital commodity? In this section, we’ll explore how Bitcoin’s utility as a commodity can make it valuable for a wide range of potential services where dollars are used today.
* **Uncorrelated Assets** – There’s a good reason believers aspire for Bitcoin to fulfill this definition – uncorrelated assets can have a big impact on portfolios. Through this lens, we explore Bitcoin’s relationship with gold and the S&amp;P 500 in order to assess its value. 

In our full report, we explore this question further, applying common valuation models from the world of real estate, collectibles and fiat currencies.

09/30/20,"There's a huge amount of people in Crypto who think that Buy&amp;Hold is the best strategy. That might be true (especially when effort vs results are considered) for more mature markets, but I felt that in Crypto, simple Trend Following should be able to catch the bulk of the big moves and avoid most of the bear markets, so I ran some tests.

# Strategies

I picked some of the most basic Trend Following strategies with reasonable/round parameters:

* **MA Crossover** (*rx\_xma*)— when fast MA crosses over slow MA, go long. I will also use several different MAs for this — EMA, LRC (LinReg), HMA, WMA, KAMA, SuperSmoother, WVMA, TEMA, ZLEMA. `Parameters used: fast MA = 5d, slow MA = 40d`
* **Supertrend** (*SupertrendXm*) — uses ATR to get band width, goes long if price over the band. `Parameters used: ATR period = 5d, band multiplier = 1.5/2/2.5`
* **Bollinger Bands Breakout** (*rx\_bb\_bout*) — goes long when price over upper band. `Parameters used: BB period = 3d/5d, BB stddev = 2, MA = EMA/LRC/SuperSmoother`
* **High/Low Breakout** (*hilo*) — goes long when price over previous X days high. Close position when under X days low. `Parameters used: period = 5d/10d`
* **Linear Regression Slope** (*expreg\_slope*) — goes long when slope of regression 0. `Parameters used: reg period = 5d/10d/15d`
* **Single MA/Price Crossover** (*rx\_xma\_single*) — goes long when price crosses over MA. Same MAs as *rx\_xma* will be used (EMA, LRC, etc). `Parameters used: reg period = 30d`
* **Single MA Slope** (*rx\_xma\_slope*) — goes long when slope of MA 0. Same MAs as *rx\_xma* will be used. `Parameters used: MA period = 20d, slope period = 1d`

# Testing setup

* Long only.
* 0.10% commission.
* Simple condition for entry (long), reverse for exit (close).
* No stoplosses or take profits.
* Use 100% of balance on each trade (will add position sizing in next post).
* 60m candle size, except for *Supertrend* (1d to get daily ATR).

# Coins and date ranges used

I will use 25 of the \~TOP50 coins and 3 different date ranges. Specific coins for each date range depend on data availability. Some will use partial range data (starting later), specified in parentheses.

**Jan 2017 — July 2020**  
Coins used: XBT, ETH, XRP (since May 18, 2017), LTC, BCH (since Aug 1, 2017), XMR, DASH (Apr 12, 2017), ETC, ZEC, GNO (since May 1, 2017), IOT (since Jun 12, 2017), REP

**Jan 2018 — July 2020**  
Coins used: all of the above + BNB, EOS, XLM, ADA, TRX, NEO, OMG

**Jan 2019 — July 2020**  
Coins used: all of the above + BSV, XTZ, LINK, ONT, QTUM, QSH

# Results

Here are the results, AVG profits over all tested assets.

* [Jan2019 - Jul2020]
* [Jan2018 - Jul2020]
* [Jan2017 - Jul2020]

# Conclusion

* Charts seem pretty conclusive to me: Trend Following Buy&amp;Hold.
* **You won't beat Buy&amp;Hold like this on each and every asset that you test or trade live. But, over multiple assets, chances are you will on average.**
* Trade frequency is a bit low (0.5 - 2 per week).
* Max drawdowns are still pretty big (60 - 80%). Need some filters, stoplosses and position/risk management.
* **While it's highly unlikely to beat pure isolated BULL market (like 2017) with basic Trend Following, over longer periods with multiple big swings, strategies catch bulk of the moves and come out ahead.**",0.031,0.906,0.063,0.948

10/26/20,"Senior Bloomberg strategist Mike McGlone has predicted that the BTC price will reach $100K by 2025 in an interview with Kitco News. McGlone pointed out that Bitcoin still has more than enough space for price growth, citing that the cryptocurrency had previously jumped from $1000 to $10000/bitcoin over the last 3 years. As for gold, even gold's uptrend has been somewhat slow compared to Bitcoin, but will not stop appreciating vs. the US dollar – and it may spike again. McGlone argued that if bitcoin can repeat its past bullish momentum, it could return to its 2019 high of $14,000 by the end of 2020.

Why it matters: There are a number of factors supporting the Bitcoin price, and mainstream investors are beginning to enter the space. With so much buying interest in Bitcoin, as well as some of the major altcoins, we are likely to see higher prices over both the medium and long term. Despite its technical limitations, Bitcoin has become the go-to alternative digital asset, and these seem to be few reasons to doubt its ability to continue to attract capital. As an alternative to central bank issues fiat currency, Bitcoin can be used anywhere these is an internet connection, and has been an excellent store of value since its inception.

11/07/20,"Disclaimer: I’ve been HODLing bitcoin the past few years.

I want to see what your guys thoughts are, I can’t help but get rid of this nagging feeling I’ve had. I hope I’m wrong but just want to see what the community thinks.

Here goes:
We all want BTC to go to $100k, but I feel as though every bull cycle is becoming shorter, and the total %gain from trough to peak are becoming worse.

For simplicity sake, I VERY roughly estimated the following cycles with ROI.

2010-2014: $.02-$1000 (5,000,000%)

2014-2017: $250-$19000 (7,600%)

2017-2020: $3000-$14000 (466%)

2020-current: $4000-$16000 (400%)

Again, these are very rough estimates just to sketch out a picture, the exact peak-trough numbers can be debated. 

That being said, the picture I’m seeing is an investment that brings worse and worse ROI with each consecutive cycle. (I know this isn’t rocket science and I’m sure most of you have thought about this too)

There are thousands of reasons why this could be the case, but I think it mostly boils down to 2 points.

1. Each cycle has a new crypto-related innovation that stokes hype and rakes in new money


I think all of us see that in each subsequent cycle, a new hype market that draws most of the attention. 
2017 was a great year for Bitcoin, but it was an amazing year for altcoins (Ethereum, Litecoin, etc.) January 2018 was just ridiculous with sh!tcoins (Tron, Neo, etc.) 2020 was a great year (after the march crash) for Bitcoin, but it was an insane year for defi.

Basically, in order to create insane ROI, you really need to drive in new money and nothing does that better than newly hyped, “innovative” products.

That’s really hard to do for Bitcoin, now that it’s matured and the market is so huge. Takes a lot more money to drive up spot prices than to drive up a random yield farming coin.

I’ll also comment some anecdotal experience that in 2017, I had friends, family, and random coworkers ask/discuss bitcoin with me because they all knew I was into it. 

This time around in 2020, not a peep from anyone. People are too busy YOLOing on r/wsb and bitcoin has taken a backseat this time around. One friend that was loosely interested in crypto asked me about defi but that was it.

2. Futures/Derivatives impact ever since Bitmex/Bitfinex.

Similar to equity markets, now that there are mature futures and derivatives markets, institutional and big money goes here. While recently there’s been a push by some companies and funds to include actual bitcoin in their portfolio, it’s not enough to move the needle 180 degrees. Most would prefer to buy OTC or in large lots through a defined seller. They ain’t pushing MARKET BUY with $100,000,000 lol.

Also, food for thought but while what’s going on in stock prices isn’t AS insane as dot-com bubble prices (but still crazy), options has done a great job of magnifying gains similar to dot-com ROI. My thinking is that futures/derivatives are having a similar impact on crypto markets. Prices don’t have to reach 2017 highs for speculators/traders to make large gains.


Ok, so what?
Basically, I wouldn’t be too surprised if $16,000 the other day was the peak of this cycle. I would love for that not to be the case, but I think bitcoin hitting around 400% ROI from peak to trough is hitting the upper limit for this market cycle. I know, an arbitrary 400% is very random and It could very well be 430% or 450%. Main point here is that the ROI from peak to trough will be less than the last cycle which was ~466%. I’m not calling the the exact top, I’m just postulating that we’re near the top of this cycle if this range bound theory happens again.

Yesterday, defi coins started giving one last dead cat bounce, and if anything I view that as an ominous sign that we’re in the 9th inning.

Whoo, sorry that was a mouthful. If you made it this far, thank you! I wanted to open up a discussion and see what some other folks think. I will always HODL bitcoin, especially with whats going on in central banks now and currencies, but I do feel as though this market cycle is wrapping up.

11/14/20,"In my opinion, the dominant pattern in bitcoin dominance is the symmetrical triangle we are currently forming.  Maybe it's obvious to everyone but I haven't seen **anyone** talk about it.



The trendlines intersect in early May, so I would expect that by late 1st quarter/early second quarter of next year, the medium term direction of bitcoin relative to other altcoins.

We don't know whether or not it will break up or down.  However, I would expect it to break up, for several reasons.

**1)**  Bitcoin functions as a competitor to gold without any additional changes or development.  It is essentially a complete project, and to be honest, doesn't really need to scale at the base layer in order to compete with gold.  It makes some sense that, due to its stock to flow, and the ""digital gold"" narrative, bitcoin might have a market cap similar to gold.    

Ethereum, by contrast, is not complete compared to what it is trying to do.  It is currently trying to move to Ethereum 2.0, and that project is possibly years away from completion (rollout keeps on getting pushed back, for one).  And of the all the altcoins out there, Ethereum is the best developed.

It just doesn't make sense for the altcoin market to be valued equally to or higher than an asset class like gold.  I expect that the market will price in the incompleteness of altcoin projects relative to bitcoin as market caps rise.

**2)**  Just look at some of the headlines.  You have microstrat and square purchasing giant amounts of bitcoin.  You have IRAN accepting payments in bitcoin.  Do you see any other companies making large purchases of Ethereum or other altcoins?

Likewise, look at the headlines when paypal allowed its users to purchase bitcoin.  Were the headlines ""Paypal lets its users purchase Ethereum""?  Or were they ""Paypal lets its users purchase Bitcoin and Ethereum""?   NO!  They were ""Paypal lets its users purchase Bitcoin"".

What this all illustrates is that bitcoin is a known quantity compared to Ethereum and altcoins.   So when crypto starts getting attention, Bitcoin will lead the way relative to altcoins.

3)  Maybe you don't believe me because my name is u/Happy_Pizza_ and not u/Rambo_Degen_God_Trader.  If so, then take it from Messari.  In their report [Crypto Thesis for 2020] (which, for the record, is a year old), they basically agree with me.

2. Bitcoin will lead, or alts will bleed An interesting thing about crypto is that bitcoin has not actually led a supercycle rally since 2013. There’s evidence to suggest that, back then, family office and accredited investor interest in the Bitcoin Investment Trust led the rally. In 2017, it was ETH and ICOs that led the rally. I remember being at the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance’s inaugural event, and it was a who’s who of “blockchain, not bitcoin” folks from the major corporates. I thought, “oh fuck, maybe I should buy some ETH just in case,” then all hell broke loose with
people raising $30 million in 30 seconds with ETH. You made money in ETH / ICOs, then you “sold” into Bitcoin on Poloniex. That was the formula. It wasn’t until later in the year that bitcoin became its own thing again following the resolution of
the SegWit2x stalemate.

Why does this history matter? Because bitcoin *itself* hasn’t sparked a proper rally in six years, and the much hyped “halving” narrative is bullshit because the magnitude of the decline in new issuance as a percentage of market cap is tiny. Instead, the 2013 and 2017 rallies were driven by new types of buyers. It just so
happens bitcoin is the most likely asset to attract the next major new type of buyer again today: institutions. There won’t necessarily be a sudden surge higher. Instead, it will be more like a snowball: one off announcements of adoption begin to increase in frequency before the price begins to tick slowly higher. I think bitcoin hits a new high before we go macro “risk off” again.

------------------------------------------------------------

However, it's not all bad news for alts.  I think bitcoin dominance will spike to the 80% range, but after that, we will be set up for a pretty nice altcoin season in the latter half of 2021.

Why?  I think there are a few reasons.

1) If bitcoin starts breaking +100k prices, that will bring an enormous amount of money into the entire crypto sphere.  Retail will feel that bitcoin is too expensive and put money into altcoins they perceive as less expensive.

2) Savy crypto hodlers and traders, who know enough about altcoins to have opinions of them, will almost certainly rotate some of their bitcoin gains into altcoins.

3)  Altcoins deserve to be funded.  Some of the stuff they are doing with decentralized finance is pretty interesting and does not compete directly with bitcoin.  People will see the potential for profit to be made, they will look for the next bitcoin, ect. 

Because of this, I expect bitcoin dominance to look something like this, for 2021.

If you’re a reasonable person you’re already puckering up your butthole. For the moment, please suspend disbelief, unclench your nether regions (around where you put your coal from last christmas), and let that diamond dislodge itself.

There’s a case to be made for one million US dollars per bitcoin. The date for that price target is the end of 2021. Yes, it’s a long-shot. Yes, that prediction requires engaging in speculation. Yes, that speculation is reckless. And, yes, we’re going to engage in that recklessness anyway. 

...And, why? Because we’re on the internet and this is supposed to be fun. And, I want /u/nannal to quit his job bagging groceries in the next 14 months. And, we’re going to do this shit because we can, just like we can start a sentence with a conjunction, you dirty little prescriptivist (please reference aforementioned ass clenching).

####First.

1) I’m a mod here, but there’s a few assholes who think that only makes me a power-hungry dictator. This isn’t an official statement, and these are my personal views.

2) I built the MoonMath site, but many other people in this sub had a hand in developing ideas and improving the site over time. Please be respectful to them and their contributions. These are just ideas and speculation, not a religion.

3) I have a lot of financial resources at stake in this discussion, and probably one metric fuck ton more than you. This halving can create a significant life change for me, or it might not.

Like many of the oldtimers around here, I’m engaging with the possibility of a wide variety of outcomes. One of those outcomes is that Bitcoin doesn’t do a damn thing in 2021. There’s a very real possibility that anybody buying bitcoin today will never see a profit. I think that probability is low, which is why I haven’t cashed out for a life changing amount of money… yet.

Or, we’ll retrace /u/merlin560 ’s long pole (gigity) but we’ll still spend more time over 18k USD/BTC than ever before. 18k will become a floor of support for Bitcoin’s price either now or later, but certainly this year. And, if bitcoin sits within 10% of an ATH for any length of time it’s going to get an ATH. **Guaran-fuck’in-teed**.

Also, /u/smksldlag ‘s mother whispered to me about a bitcoin ATH this year. (hey Siri, set a reminder to DM /u/smksldlag ‘s mother and have her top up my cell phone so I can call her late night like she likes.)

###This Bull run is kicking off early and fast

OBV shows accumulation and distribution of an asset on longer timeframes, especially when you look at the daily or weekly chart. [We can see] that bull markets consistently show rapid accumulation in BTC through halving events and that this time we’re moving at a pace that more resembles the 2012 halving, but with more speed, greater longevity, and more stability; the market isn’t hesitating as expected, neither when nor where.

###The price of Bitcoin is more stable than ever

Getting in fights over the stability of bitcoin was normal for me in 2016. I’d argue that bitcoin is getting more stable over time and other people would tell me that there’s no evidence for that… and that I’m full of shit.

 Those people may have been right then, but sure as a duck’s dick drags weeds I’m right today. Weekly Bollinger Band widths [show a clear trend toward greater overall stability in the price of bitcoin]

A stable bitcoin is a mature bitcoin, and we all know how much institutional investors want to see greater stability in uncorrelated assets that yield high returns. Diversification isn’t just for /u/smksldlag ‘s mother.

###Retail investment is through the roof

Bitcoin didn’t always have a vast selection of exchanges. In fact, there was a substantial period of time where you’d have to use a credit card or personal loan if you wanted to use leverage to buy bitcoin. Leveraged positions on an exchange first became available to Bitcoin in March of 2013, and [the rapid expansion of credit available to bitcoin markets shows the role it played in both the boom and the bust cycles of Bitcoin in our first major bull run] Analysis of that chart shows that retail’s percent of trade volume dropped rapidly in 2013, and never really recovered. However, the last 9 months show a dramatic real shift away from credit based trading. Markets are moving toward real cash-based purchases and that leveraged traders and exchanges have been effectively pushed out of the market. **Today, for the first time in three years, OTC sources make up more than half of bitcoin’s volume**, and the trend is still up.

###Altcoins probably aren’t going to recover
Or, at least, the altcoins that were popular in the last cycle will not be as popular in this one.

[The previous MoonMath update] made a few pessimistic predictions about shitcoin markets, and basically pegged where we’re at now. Also, I did not predict the dramatic drop in price that we saw as a result of coronavirus earlier this year. In retrospect, I probably should’ve known that the macro economic cycles of the world are actually impacting Bitcoin's price now. However the price was like 9k or 10k when I wrote the last update, and that’s about where we were two months ago.

###Institutions are here

... and they have no shits for your shitcoins

If rumors prove out, we will see that all large-fund managers will want some level of exposure to Bitcoin in the near future. That’s hard to imagine today, but for the first time it’s actually possible. Smart money will not drive the boom and bust cycles that we’ve seen from Bitcoin enthusiasts who are native to this market. When smart money talks, that bullshit walks.

Altcoins were a major limiting factor in the last bull run because they created a mirage of too much hypothetical (non real) value and combined forces with CME to pop the bull run early.

##Let’s round things out


* The bull is early, fast, stable, and has demonstrated longevity
* Even though we’re in a bull run, the price is more stable than ever
* Retail investment is insanely high
* Bitcoin scored a 33-month high to round out October and probably will again in November
* Bitcoin continues to be an uncorrelated asset, and it is breaking away from trends in the S&amp;P 500, as well as VIX (Exposure to uncorrelated assets is ideal to fund managers)
* 70,000 bitcoins left wallets that had more than 100 bitcoins in October. However, wallets with less than 100 bitcoin more than made up for the needed demand
* Your altcoin is non real and has no demonstrated value after 4 more years of time to invent it.

In response to new guidance from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, we are disabling our margin trading product.

Customers currently using margin trading will not be able to place new margin trades starting 2pm PT on November 25. For customers using credit, all open limit orders will be cancelled at this time. The product will be taken offline in December once all existing margin positions have expired.

We believe clear, common sense regulations for margin lending products are needed to protect and provide peace of mind to U.S customers. We look forward to working closely with regulators to achieve this goal.

# Margin Trading FAQ

## Why are you shutting down Margin Trading?

Due to recent changes in our regulatory environment, we are no longer able to offer this product to retail investors.

## What will happen to my existing Margin positions?

Your existing Margin positions that were created before  2pm PT on Nov 25 will not be affected. At the expiration of your loan term (25th day from the date of origination), your positions will be closed out by selling crypto for the value of the loan. Once the loan is closed, you will not be able to enter into a new Margin position, nor will we enter into a position on your behalf.

## Why are my open limit orders being canceled?

When you create an order on Coinbase Pro, we check your buying power before the order is created. Once Margin Trading becomes unavailable, your buying power decreases and we thus might not be able to execute any orders that were already created. 

## Will I still have access to reporting for Margin trades?

You can access your previous trades (including Margin trades) via the “Orders” or “Statements” sections of your account.

11/26/20," 

In response to a comment by [/u/slippyjke] in which he says 'we're headed down, so how far?' I wrote most of this and then realized it's just too long for a comment reply.

Nobody knows. Nobody knows how far down, or up. That said, seriously? BTC held over $10,000 since August. That in itself is huge. If anything at all above $10,000 is true support we have entered a new era.

**Heading down?** It's been like 12 hours and a rejection of 19,500 and break of 18,000 support. A few weeks ago 11,000 was a reason to celebrate. Seriously, calm thine tits.

As for price predictions I won't Mcafee my right hand's boyfriend but I've been right with 80% of my guesses and here's what I've been saying since the 10k breakout. Temper these with the news that some people are saying Mnuchin is going to try to impose greater restrictions on non-verified wallets getting remittances from exchanges, which I haven't thought deeply enough about yet and which might be contributing to the 19.5 rejection:

1. Holding above 10k support was and remains huge. It shows a low more promise and interest and I hope it stays this way. It's mainly psychological but it also means that 1 bitcoin is now above the mandatory reporting minimums to the IRS in dollar amounts when deposited to a bank. In other words it ""seems"" that the community is more comfortable with being held tax accountable every day BTC is above 10k. Yes, everyone knows you can buy / sell / send as much or little BTC as you like. Not the point. To some, appearance is reality.
2. Big moves have big corrections. Back in the ancient days, the hairy days, the blood and glory days of twenny ought 17 when men were men and Hodlers were bodler (I swear to god, Oliver, if you steal this writing like you did my other memes I will pound you like you wish Adam Driver would) I knew this but didn't heed my own advice. I bought my second BTC on the famed bull run at 11k. This was a small mistake. I did not sell at $20k. This was a bigger mistake. If I had done so I could have bought 6 BTC when it hit $3,000 and had money left over. Intellectually I knew it would have to correct but I didn't listen to my brain. And I made the other stupid mistake: Trying to time the market. My incorrect prediction, to myself, was that it would bounce and rise and then continue to rise soon. But... soon didn't come until this August, did it? Do yourself a favor and don't listen to the gifs. Buy BTC because you believe in it or don't buy it, a weak hand won't help you and these gifs and the memes and nonsense are just one bit jackass yelling BITCONNEEEEEEEEEECT. Seriously: They try to sell the sizzle *but you need to buy the steak.*
3. What happened yesterday is called a rejection of a double bottom. It's basically a failed bounce and it shows weak support at a given price level. Everyone knew $20,000 is an historic ceiling. It's a big resistance level to approach, let alone break. Many speculators, traders and Hodlers were watching it and ready to sell at that price or to GTFO just before it to reduce their risk basis from when they bought in 2017. Probably tons of limit orders in the book SINCE then! The 18.5 temporary support was, largely, people betting on a breakout. A lot of those people lost faith in that breakout when 19.5 was rejected and, foop, the floor fell out. It's *not* a big deal. I, for one, am MORE than satisfied if BTC trades between $10,000 and $20,000 for now. A $10,000 floor is a big win. Now people are going to tell you technical analysis is bullshit and nonsense and reading tea leaves. OK, well, make up your own mind. You can see exactly how many trades happened at a given price at a given time and all the trades so if you can't read into that I guess it'll seem mysterious and magical malarkey to you. But if you can look at the chart and see that people were more than willing to buy and sell BTC at 17,000 today when they were only buying and selling it at this volume for 8,000 a couple months ago I think that fall from 19,000 might just not seem quite so intimidating.
4. Many people were waiting for the run to end. I wish I weren't asleep for it, I'd have sold and rebought this morning. Might should have and made a few thousand bucks. But simply put when everyone is watching the big red light and standing with one foot out the door there's a predictable result. But, hold up, it's Thanksgiving day and the price has fallen three thousand bucks and... it's bouncing a little already? Not a huge deal. Maybe it continues down week over week but I don't see a big problem.

So, my predictions and we'll see if I can improve my 80% success record!

1. I am watching the $15,000 zone as a support indicator. It seems to be a good retracement point and if BTC doesn't draw out a new floor above it ($16,000 seems likely) and $15,000 creates a good bounce I think there's a damn good chance this is a hickup on the way back up to $20,000. I really think $15,000 will set the mood if $16,000 doesn't.
2. I'm strongly considering buying back in at $13,000. Typically I'll want to catch an uptrend so this is hard with so many predicting $13,000/$13.5 as a hard floor right now but with all the froth in BTC it's not hard to see it go to 12.5 before a bounce. If the price falls under $15,000 and bounces before $13,000 it'd have to be a pretty strong bounce to convince me to buy back at that time. You can say I'm dumb but if you're a super-bull then what's the difference if I have one less BTC? Moon is moon, babe. My reason for selling on this run up was this exact situation (oh shit, 85% now!).
3. My bull case is BTC holds above $13,000 and climbs (relatively) slowly past $20,000 and continues to climb, watching short term corrections at every thousand dollar level before 20 and $500 after 20. My bear case is BTC breaks $13,000 support and slowly falls under $10,000 and seeks a floor in the high $8,000's before correlating with the stock market or opposite of inflation. I'm watching $15,000 to see which is more likely. The strength of hands is what's important. If we consolidate above $15,000 for the long weekend I am more than a happy camper.
4. Looking at the order book on coinbase it's quite clear the big wall here is just $20k. It's a climb, but it's not at all unlikely to get there. My super-bull case is some upcoming news regarding institutional buyers and the dwindling supply causing a great surge in demand and strong hands refusing to sell. My extreme long-term price for BTC has no upper limit, I see it growing in price for my entire life or until something is able to replace it. I find a replacement very unlikely simply because, seeing how disruptive it is and how much gov'ts wanted to shut it down, I expect they'll put the kibosh on anything with similar qualities that begins to emerge.",0.087,0.773,0.14,0.9976

I am not an options expert by any means so I want to make sure I'm not missing something. As of today, with BTC at roughly $19,400, it appears one can sell 100 June 2021 $25,000 calls (= 1BTC) for roughly $5,000. As such, one can generate a bit over 25% on the current price of BTC in six months (or 50% a year if similar conditions exists six months from now to repeat the trade).

12/06/20,"I used trade data and orderbook snapshots from 15 spot and 6 derivative exchanges in their BTC/USD and/or BTC/USDT pair to attempt to find an explanation for Bitcoin's sharp price fall from 19.9k on December 1, 2020. In my analysis, I observed dynamics that told a story behind price movement in the Bitcoin Market.

*I have also written this post in my blog [here] The charts may be easier to look at there.

# Summary
- At 11:10 UTC BTC price was at 19.9k. At this time orderbook in both the bid and the ask side decreased substantially. This stopped the roadblock from a potential breakout in either direction
- For the next few minutes selling increased while buying didn't. As the orderbook had grown fickle in both directions at this point, selling pushed it to the lower side.
- Afterwards, Liquidation was responsible for most of the sharp movement


# Data
I used data from the following exchanges and pairs:

- **BTC-USD Spot:** Binance, BinanceUS, Bitfinex, Bitstamp, Coinbase, FTX, FTXUS, Gemini, HitBTC, Kraken
- **BTC-USDT Spot:** Binance, Bitfinex, Bitmax, Bittrex, FTX, FTXUS, Huobi, Kraken, OKEx, Poloniex
- **BTC-USD Derivative:** Bitmex, Bybit, Bittrex, FTX, Huobi, OKEx
- **BTC-USDT Derivative:** Binance

I did not use TUSD, USDC, BUSD, and EUR markets here as I found them to be too small.

# Orderbook
I took a snapshot of the orderbook a few times every minute in all pairs depending on how often the orderbook changes. This way, I took more snapshots for orderbooks that change frequently and less for those who changeless. Then I calculated the orderbook depth - the amount needed for a 100$ move in both directions. Then i averaged the snapshots of the amount required for a 100$ movement in the given minute to get the average amount required for that minute for the given pair in the given exchange. Then I grouped the data into spot and derivative by adding in such pair to obtain [this chart]

The Red line is the sell-side, and the green line the buy-side. When the red line is higher, it means the sell-side is significant, and it is hard for the price to rise. Similarly, when the green line is significant, the buy-side is bigger. Its axis is on the left. The light blue line is close price and golden line the average price of BTC. Its axis is on the right. The depth in spot exchanges have been scaled up a bit in the chart as I think comparing spots to derivative depth 1:1 is not fair.


There is plenty of information to digest in this chart. As bitcoin reached 19.9k heavy buy and sell orders popped up at 11:06. But at 11:10, they were removed, and the amount required for the price to move fell substantially. I manually plotted the random snapshot of orderbooks of all the exchange and found that most of this action took place at [Coinbase] in spot and [Bitmex] in derivative ([Kraken] [Bybit] [BinanceFutures] and [Huobi] depth for comparision). This fall in orderbook depth made a movement in either direction more likely.

# Trades
I summed the amount of buying and selling that took place in every 30-second interval. Then I divided each interval's amount by the last 100 intervals' moving average to get a normalized amount. Then I plotted the 10 intervals (5 mins) moving average of the 30-second data to [obtain this]


The green and red line show the intensity of buying/selling. Higher green line means that buying is much higher than the average buying in the last 50 minutes. If the line is rising faster, it means buying/selling is increasing heavily. If it is falling fast, the average buying/selling is decreasing. For buying and selling, a log axis is used on the right side. For value, the orange line's axis is on the right.

After 11:10, both buying and selling fell on average. But buying fell much faster than selling. I created a cumulative sum of the amount sold/brought since 11:00 UTC below to get the [this chart]


Here the green line shows the total amount of bitcoin brought in all these exchanges, and the red shows the amount sold. Its log axis is on the left. The orange line is the price. Here it is visible that buying starts bigger than selling. But after the slight dip at 11:10, selling keeps increasing, eventually leading to a price crumble.




# Liquidations
This section's analysis is only based on BitMEX's liquidation data. While concluding, I assume that Bitmex's liquidation represents the amount in other derivative exchanges. I think it's a fair assumption given that [I have written] how the bitmex derivative market frequently leads spot markets.

From 11:20 UTC to 11:26 UTC, the bitcoin price fell from ~19800 to ~19100. 150 Million $ was traded in Bitmex at this time. Of them, 6.8 Million $ was liquidation. ~5% of all the trades during this time were liquidations. There were a total of 12 liquidations.

Zooming in the massive role of liquidation gets more clear:
- Bitcoin price fell ~250$ from 19808$ to 19568$ from 11:20:34 to 11:20:51 in a 17-second interval. 8% of the volume was liquidations. 5 of the 12 liquidations took place at this time.
- Bitcoin price fell ~200$ from 19540$ to 19333$ from 11:25:20 to 11:25:33 in a 13-second interval. 36% of the volume was liquidations. 5 of the 12 liquidations took place at this time.

This considerable proportion and liquidation occurrence in sharp movements shows how liquidations enhance trends in the bitcoin market.

# Conclusion
All this information tells a story on the dynamics of play in the bitcoin market. In this particular case, a change in orderbook depth allowed a movement to happen. Selling pushed the price low. Liquidations pushed the price lower. Fundamental factors define market dynamic in the long run, and this zoomed-in analysis in the market dynamic might give some people biased conclusions. But, Market dynamics are still influential in the short/medium-term price movement. We have seen how bitcoin moves sharply in short intervals nowadays. And this case provides a good insight into how/why bitcoin moves sharply in such a way and is thus good knowledge for traders.

# Final Words
I wonder how backtesting an automatic trading system based on the orderbook change and trades keeping in mind liquidation would perform. I am sure it would beat buy and hold if appropriately done (as I have been beating it with a more straightforward system). But unfortunately, I didn't collect this data in the past, and i can't afford paying over 10k€ (Kaiko charges 2k€ per exchange for the trade data, and who knows how much for the obook) for these data. Fortunately, I am collecting it now, so I will have better analysis and insights to share with enough data in the future. And hopefully better trading systems for me personally!",0.025,0.918,0.057,0.989

12/07/20,"  MoonDeFi is a protocol on Ethereum for swapping ERC20 tokens without the need for buyers and sellers to create demand. It does this via an equation that automatically sets and balances the value depending on how much demand there is. Unlike most exchanges that charge fees, MoonDeFi was designed with a very low fee structure.  On MoonDeFi, Traders can exchange Ethereum tokens without having to trust anyone with their money. Users can lend their cryptocurrencies to the liquidity pool and collect a fee. This is done by an equation that automatically determines and balances the value based on actual demand. This is one of the first fully decentralized protocols for automated liquidity provision in the Defi. There’s no company involved, no KYC, and there’s no person involved that’s mediating things.

However with only a few days remaining it seems there’s a chance it may not happen after all, meaning the two economies would revert to WTO rules, with tariffs, closed borders etc This would result in a shock for the entire European economy.

12/23/20,"A month ago, [I made a post on bitcoin dominance and how it was in a large symmetrical triangle.]  I posted that I expect that it will break up out of the triangle.

Well, here we are.  Bitcoin has broken up as I predicted:  

Based on the angle of previous rises in bitcoin dominance, I expect that we will hit 80% bitcoin dominance some time in late Feburary to April.  I'm predicting we will hit 80% bitcoin dominance because that's the biggest historical gap in bitcoin dominance in the chart.

Intriguingly, [the stock to flow model suggests that bitcoin] will hit 75k some time in late April.  [I have discussed elsewhere that I expect the top to be around 150-350k]  To expand on the reasoning in that post, the range I calculated for possible bitcoin tops assumes the bottom will be 80-84% of the top and the bottom will be 1.5-3x higher than the previous top (so 30k-60k). You can do math to get the range of 150k-350k for the top.  

What this means is that if bitcoin's price starts to get around 100k, then bitcoin's upside will be limited to 2-4x.  But if altcoin ratios, as represented by bitcoin dominance, are low, then altcoin's upside relative to bitcoin may be much more favorable than 2-4x.

If, in mid-April, bitcoin dominance is at +80% while bitcoin is also at +70k, that is the optimal time to switch from bitcoin into altcoins.  Right now, everything seems to be lining up for that play.

12/26/20,"Speculatively forecasting the price of Bitcoin via subjectively using the Elliott Wave principle:

[

The Elliott Wave principle is a method of technical analysis used to track and forecast the nature of financial markets. The theory suggests markets move in waves based on investor psychology: three impulsive waves to progress the overall trend, intercorrelated with two corrective waves of regress. Thereby, a set of five waves complete an overall waveset or cycle. Upon completion, the five wave structure is regressed by three waves to complete an overall opposing waveset or cycle. The pattern of waves emerge repeating on multiple timeframes denoted by degrees, producing a fractal. Fibonacci-based relationships often exist between the waves.

A potential Elliott Wave model of Bitcoin proposes a structure of five Primary degree waves underway since 2010 —consisting of three advancing bull market waves, interwoven with two declining bear market waves, as follows:

    Wave 1: The first bull market wave 2010-2013 (1148 days)
    Wave 2: The first bear market wave 2013-2015 (413 days)
    Wave 3: The second bull market wave 2015-2018 (1064 days)
    Wave 4: The second bear market wave 2018-2019 (364 days)
    Wave 5: The third and final bull market wave 2019-?

Using  BraveNewCoin Liquid Index (BLX:BNC) pricing, here are Fibonacci-based projection target zones for Wave 5...

    $34,575  : Wave 5 = Wave 3 * 0.500%
    $60,864  : Wave 5 = Wave 3 * 0.618%
    $136,152 : Wave 5 = Wave 3 * 0.786%
    $219,866 : Wave 5 = Wave 3 * 0.886%
    $379,693 : Wave 5 = Wave 3 * 1.000%

The magnitude of the bull market impulsive waves which progress the trend, are as follows...

    Wave 1 = 1178  points, 3666017%
    Wave 3 = 19601 points, 11961%
    Wave 5 = 21900 points, 700% (thus far as of Christmas Day 2020)

Since Wave 3 cannot be the smallest in magnitude as defined by Elliott Wave theory, therefore the maximum upside potential for Wave 5 is...

    $379,693 : Wave 5 = Wave 3 * 1.000%

Upon completion of Wave 5, i.e. completion of a waveset or cycle, the entire advance from 2010 is expected to be regressed by three waves to complete an overall opposing waveset or cycle —a bear market declining around 95% in value, representing the largest decline since inception.

12/29/20,"## MoontMath: The Bottoms Update



Seeing some chatter about the range of what we can expect in this bull cycle and I have some thoughts on this. So, I'm making a slightly longer than usual comment. And, since we're talking about something that's totally speculative and fanciful I'm wrapping it up with Moon Math.

The framing of this question comes from u/biggunsg0b00m

&gt;We've heard everyone's posit on what our next ATH is,  but i haven't heard anyone mention what they think the next bear cycle will take us down to.
&gt;
&gt;Do we need a high before we can predict that?  
&gt;
&gt;I seem to recall that once a new bull run has begun btc has never gone below the previous ATH, but I'm wondering if that's a firm rule in most trading analysis?

This question is excellent. Focusing on the bottom lets you think rationally about the top. Unfortunately, pondering this question has me contemplating the bottom as a function of the top... and really about the structure of the whole bull market.

When I think about bitcoin and the CC ecosystem that it has spawned I keep watching a video of a concentric wave singularity over and over:



I worked on an experiment down the street from that lab after University, and the work they did always had bizarre ineffable relevance to my own career.

When I think about bitcoin and CC I'm considering the movement of the paddles, and the feedback from waves moving back against paddles; paddles and waves working together and producing progressively more powerful concentric wave forms. Each paddle is an altcoin and the value of the whole ecosystem is height, from peak to trough, of the waveform that is produced.

/u/biggunsg0b00m 's question is focused on the trough of that wave form. They ask ""what is the base value of bitcoin after the irrational spike is over?""

Waves displace water, so the larger the wave the deeper the trough, but a tide is still a tide.

##duh fuq is with this metaphor?

1. The price of bitcoin is influenced by participants in the space. Fewer participants means less water and smaller waves; less value AND less volatility.
1. Bigger paddles with more power = bigger waves.
1. PA can happen that is disproportionate to the number of participants; real value.
1. We can create a value singularity like we saw in 2013 and 2017 that kills the market for years. Distinct forces create them each time. We can watch them pumping the market in real time.
1. We have a tide in the form of the halving and new market participants. **The tide is the tide regardless of the waves**

##The fucking question is about the bottom, yeah?

Getting there. We can't predict the bottom because we don't really know how much the market is going to increase. I think we all believe that the amount of water in our wave tank is increasing thanks to institutions, and that these institutions have giant fucking paddles. However, we also know that institutions are more likely to exercise restraint in their decision making.

Regardless, new institutions raise the level of the water. 

##Numbers, bitch?

It is not possible to acquire even 5% of all bitcoin, no matter how much money you have. If you attempt to buy 5% of all bitcoin it will drive the price up substantially beyond affordability for any institution or person to afford. Michael Saylor increased the price of bitcoin by perhaps 25% - 50% by acquiring less than 1% of all bitcoin over 8 months. 

Bitcoin just went over 500 billion in market cap. 5% is 25 billion. If you were to try to buy 25 billion in bitcoin you can look forward to driving the price of bitcoin up over 500% and you would acquire, perhaps, 2% of all bitcoin. You hit 2/5ths of your target and made a big ass wave.

You need about 33 billion dollars invested in bitcoin every year to support 100k. That's just to cover the cost of mining. So, you pumped the price of bitcoin to 125k with your 25 billion and then the market crashed because that 25 billion in cash doesn't cover the cost of mining.

##You need to add more water if you want to meaningfully raise the bottom of the wave

To hold bitcoin in this range we need to ensure that 22 million is available to miners every day. That's something like eight and a quarter billion bucks a year. Fuck me, right? But, that's just 7 more Michael Saylors. Grayscale covers that without taking any other institutions, businesses, exchanges, governments, or individuals into consideration.

## Sell pressure, you fucking idiot

Yeah, yeah. There is a pool of coins that's just waiting to hit their price target, too. So, you're making millionaires all along the way, too. Those folks are putting pressure on the market and actually stabilizing it. When we make new millionaires it keeps the concentric wave singularity from happening.

The pool of sellers is incredibly important for market stability, but they also add to the underlying cost of the network. However, I don't believe they contribute substantially to the trough of our concentric waves.

##The most important thing to consider is the depth of the water

Yeah, dummy. The wave shit just happens on the surface, but when you look at that concentric wave singularity it shoots up out of the water three times higher than the depth of the pool.

## Oh fuck

So what's the bottom? **I don't fucking know**, but I do think it's a substantially higher place than where we are now. Not, just 2x or 3x above the previous ATH. If we have big players entering these waters we aren't just getting more water; we're getting a bigger fucking tank.

Also, institutions might be smart enough to prevent a concentric wave singularity, but they're still adding water. The bottom could be 10x or 100x from here. We just don't know how fast or how many of the big kids are going to get into the pool.

**Also, alts, OTC, and degenerate gamblers are still making god damned waves.**

**Today is the latest day of 2020 — a year so many are prepared to bid farewell to and never glance back at. In any case, for Bitcoin, the cryptographic money is going to finish off its most significant year yet.**

Simultaneously, the resource additionally shuts the most recent ten years as the best performing resource since 2011, underscoring a time of development that is just barely starting. Here’s the means by which Bitcoin piled facing the remainder of the universe of account throughout the most recent decade.

### From Early Bitcoin Beginnings To Now

The Bitcoin white paper was first appropriated in 2008, and the beginning square that started everything was mined in 2009. In 2010, the principal notable business exchange including BTC and two pizzas occurred.

From that point, it has kept on being utilized accordingly yet in addition has taken on numerous other use cases as its market cap has developed. Today, in 2020, organizations, tycoons, superstars, and partnerships are currently purchasing BTC to store worth and support against swelling.



### How The Cryptocurrency Compares Over The Last Decade

From the resource’s initial days in 2011 as an arising type of distributed electronic money to the current advanced gold account, the cost per BTC has developed to just shy of $30,000.

**Information shows that the cryptographic money has beated each other resource in the course of the most recent ten years, with a stunning 6 million percent expansion. This likens to over 200% annualized returns, with the following best entertainer being the Nasdaq 100 at simply 20% annualized returns.**

Taking a gander at it from the point of view that the resource has just developed from under $1 to $30,000 and over 6,000,000% gives the bogus impression that is it’s past the point where it is possible to put resources into Bitcoin. But since of the digital money’s latent capacity and guarantee, it could at last arrive at costs of many thousands to millions for every coin.

**The absolute most splendid speculators alive case getting into Bitcoin even now resembles putting resources into Google or Apple early. Similarly the same number of cynics exist, be that as it may, yet individuals frequently disagree with what they can’t comprehend.**

Others have contrasted Bitcoin with the web, and like that innovation — including email, sites, and that’s only the tip of the iceberg — was completely trashed from the outset and thought to never supplant existing frameworks.

**Is a similar destiny as the web ahead for Bitcoin as the resource’s most significant year and it’s first entire decade past evidence of idea stage?**",0.014,0.896,0.09,0.9826

01/02/21,"tl;dr you can use [LeverageYourCoins.com] to calculate profit/loss potential of leveraged long bets on bitcoin.

I know that the standard advice for bitcoin is to buy and hodl for many years, and this is great advice, but it's still useful to know about and consider the potential of leverage. Leverage has a different risk/reward profile than buy/hodl, and that may appeal to you.

**What is leverage for bitcoin?**

Making a leveraged bet increases your risk/reward profile. With leverage, you can gain (or lose!) additional BTC. This is different than buy &amp; hodl, where your USD value changes, but you can never gain/lose BTC.

**What's an example of a leveraged long bet on bitcoin?**

Suppose you have 1 BTC in assets. You think the price will increase to $100k within 2 years, and you're willing to bet 20% of your BTC on this. You can purchase perpetual on BitMex, and if you're right, you'll have a gain of 10% (+.1 BTC), on top of your USD gains.

**I hear you should never use leverage**

Many people will tell you to never use leverage, and that only professional traders should do so. While it's true that leverage can be complicated, I view this a ""abstinence only"" advice. I think safe and informed use of leverage can be valuable.

**What's complicated about leverage?**

Different leverage contracts have different risk/reward behavior. Options can expire worthless if your target price doesn't hit fast enough, and futures can result in liquidation if the price drops too low.

The tool I made, [LeverageYourCoins.com] computes all these risks based on your price target and risk tolerance. Then, it pulls live data from different exchanges like BitMex and Deribit, and figures out the best way to leverage based on your price target/risk. It also tells you how many contracts to purchase, which is important for avoiding liquidation. It takes into account your time horizon, and uses that the compute interest.

As an example, suppose you think the price will increase to $100k or more within 2 years, and you want to risk 25% of your assets. As I write this, the best leverage for this target/risk is to buy 0.2 worth of BitMex perpetual contracts [(see example 1)] However, if you think $100k will hit within 1 year, then it's better to buy a Deribit Call priced at $48k, expiring Dec 2021. [(see example 2)]

**How much can I gain/lose with leverage?**

For each scenario, the tool will tell you your potential profit/loss, and show a table with different risk and price levels. Make sure to read this table, and see if it matches your comfort level with risk.

Leverage is a powerful, and I'm hoping this tool will demystify it a bit for people. Let me know what you think!",0.044,0.779,0.177,0.9971

##This market is unreasonable.

It’s worth remembering where we were In the first week of 2017.

Bitcoin was ascending, but only to the ATH and then bouncing off it for a 40% correction. Bitcoin wasn’t making a new ATH, and significant market pressure kept it from even approaching that.

The entire month of January 2017 was a compromise; the remaining month clawing, slowly, back to the ATH. The first ATH in 3 years was set in the middle of February, and through that period many people in this subreddit did not believe bitcoin would ever recover.

6 weeks of extreme volatility for a new ATH that triggered yet another 40% correction.

The bull we’re seeing today didn’t emerge in 2017 until the middle of April that year. 7 weeks of relentless bull PA saw the price of bitcoin more than double before the price retraced 40%, again, over 5 weeks.

We keep looking at PA and expecting a painful retrace because that’s what bitcoin has always done in the past.

Bitcoin will retrace. We do not know when or how and we are past due. The big one will come. We should expect several of them.

It’s also possible that the ceiling on this is higher than any of us is willing to say.

No sleep until 50k.

##Where Pull Back?

We should see a pull back here, and we're just not. I see hammers forming all the way down, and we're already headed back up over 33k as I write this. Bitcoin should pull back, and it just isn't doing that.

Supply is gone. I can point to some places like this, and I will.

##2012 Bull Run: Round 1



Supply dries up and serious  money starts flowing into Bitcoin for the first time. Previously, Not even drug dealers were aware of bitcoin. The community is a wreck and unprepared. Supply just isn't there, and silk road is on fire.

## 2013 Bull Run: Round 2



Silk road is destroyed and brief panic tanks the market. Supply is bought back up almost immediately and early investors realize that bitcoin is being used for more than drugs and human trafficking online. Willy bot pushes Bitcoin to new highs. China FUD and MtGox being absolute shit are real, but not generally known or accepted.

## 2016 Bull Run: Round 3



Altcoins develop inflated value and rush into bitcoin, pumping the price as a safe haven from artificially high valuations for ridiculous projects. Each round of altcoin pump and dumps pushes bitcoin to new heights. Nobody is really able to see the impact that alts are playing in the market, but BTCs limited supply and recent halving make it a place to escape to when dumping digital assets. Altcoiners believe that if they trade into bitcoin then they don't have to pay taxes on the trade. People do debate if alt sales are going into BTC or cash.

## 2017 Bull Run: Round 4



Decentralized and international exchanges allow speculation on altcoins to get out of hand. Coinbase isn't able to function under the load for sign up requests and regularly goes down when trading volume is high. Gemini is announced. ETF rumors abound (obviously, it never happens).


## So what?

Bull markets are becoming more condensed and sell-offs shorter and of smaller magnitude. It's possible that we're not going to see sustained pullback for months, if at all in 2021.

here's what I mean:

Round 1 &amp; 2 combined:



Round 3 &amp; 4 combined (without retraces):



Irresponsible speculation, because we all just can't wait.

01/03/21,"Looking at the technical analysis of the price of Bitcoin (BTC) over time and its history of making parabolic price movements I've come up with a very interesting and specific bitcoin price forecast for 2021-2023 based on all of its historical parabolic movements.

Here's a Bitcoin Parabolic Chart from 2017 that helps you see the parabolic movements visually:

[

Given all of the new all time highs set by bitcoin in the past, they are almost always followed by a swift 30% decline in the price of bitcoin before the bearish selling momentum turns back to bullish buying again.

Given the new ATH $35,000 bitcoin price, a 30% decline of $11,500 will soon bring the bitcoin price back down to ($23,500-$24,000) 

$24,000 is also a key resistance level above $20K that needs to be retested both technically &amp; psychologically. 

Bitcoin will need to survive the $24K level crash to form a new base bottom before the next big move of BTC price can move up 10X. 

When looking at the 10X run in 2014 from $120 to $1,200, immediately following the 10X move up BTC price gave back 83% of its value crashing back down to $200 in 2015. 

2017 saw Bitcoin go from $1,100 to $19,600 - before giving up 84% to $3150 in 2018. 

So, now that the shorts have been squeezed and the mania has peaked brining BTC to the recent parabolic move to $35,000, selling has already begun and the move down to $24,000 is under way now. 

IF bitcoin can survive the crash to $24,000 throughout trading levels in 2021 and find a bottom for itself at the $24,000 base price  in 2021 then it could begin its next parabolic move of 10X up to potentially $240,000 by the end of 2023.

That is the best case scenario in my analysis.

However, If Bitcoin can not find a itself a new base at $24,000, then a second crash will cause the bitcoin price to then retest the $20,000 level. 

If that $20,000 bitcoin price fails, a swift \~33% crash would take bitcoin back down to a very solid $12,000 resistance level. 

There's still a fairly realistic chance that Bitcoin gives up nearly 84 % AGAIN like IT DID in after BOTH of the last 2 major parabolic moves up. 

It gave up 84% in the 2018 crash after the 2017 ATH $19,600 which crashed all the way down to $3,150, just like it gave up 84% of its value from $1,200 to $200.

So... in 2020 Bitcoin rose \~10X from $3100 to $30,000.

Could yet another 84% crash happen for a three peat?

In that ultimate worst case 84% loss scenario that we've seen happen after both of the last two 10X+ moves, Bitcoin would bottom around $5,520 after a third 84% crash. 

In that case, a 10X move up would take bitcoin to $55,200 by the end of 2023.

So what do you all think?

Is a bitcoin price crash to $24,000 going to be the next big parabolic price movement? 

What do you think the price will likely be by the end of 2023?

$55,200 or $240,000? or something else altogether and why?

Hopefully it will find good support at $24,000 and go back up, however, Time alone will tell ... 

Congrats to all the hodlers but don't get greedy ;)

01/06/21,"I started becoming interested in crypto a couple of months ago, and have happily watched my holdings rise since then (just BTC and Ethereum). I'm sold on the belief that generally, what goes up must come down, and I would be very surprised if there was not another drawdown to at least 24k support levels in the next month or so, and perhaps much lower if there's some kind of Black Swan regulatory event/security flaw/internet outage/whatever.

I don't want to be left like the slow-moving HODLers who kept their crypto after the post-2018 crash. I want to time my exit right near the top, then buy when it gets low again.

My questions are twofold: (1) Does it seem reasonable that history will ""rhyme,"" that there will be a repetition of the 2018 bull market and crash? Or is it possible that Bitcoin will never be below 30k again? Also, (2) if you do expect that there will be a big drawdown in Bitcoin (and by extension, the rest of the crypto market), what are your strategies for timing the top so you can take your profits?",0.061,0.835,0.104,0.8621

Anna, and her small insider cult following, appears to be unaware that paying customer reviews are permitted and now want vengeance (please see some below comments). Censorship is *never* OK, and I will continue to speak up; it is a civil right.

\----------------------------

For anyone who is new to this and looking to start BTC/ALT coin trading, I feel the need to get the word out so that someone else doesn't make the same stupid mistake that I did...

As someone who for *whatever reason* bought Anna Macko's $1,997 2% theory bundle (trust me, I feel like a total imbecile rn), all I can say is **don't buy it!** Most (me included) bought via her Instagram, where she now has close to 400,000 followers. Her courses are an absolute **mess.** Tons of duplicate videos, many are also incoherent, outdated or beyond vague.

Anna doesn't believe in technical analysis or learning how to read charts, and so doesn't teach it to her students. Without exaggerating, you learn almost **nothing.** Support is minimal to non-existent. Questions go unanswered by Anna, and there are *no* moderators in the Facebook group.

The picture is actually even worse, as her $100/day course is basically just Anna giving you her affiliate link for crypto dot com. More money for Anna!

Anna is also currently trying to charge $14,999.99 for a one-to-one. [

Suppose you dare to voice any of your concerns to Anna in private, or hell, want to get a refund? Good luck. Anna will accuse you of making **""defamatory statements""** against her or being a **""hater""**, and then remove you from the crappy Facebook group and signals channel. Furthermore, this has happened to members who have been perceived by Anna to be 'negative', or who don't sing her praises 24/7. There is also another particular trading course and group, which if you are part of, means automatic removal from Anna's. You are booted, ghosted, and with no refund - see *proof* below.

She spends most days banging on about ""the scammers!"" when Anna is the only *real* scammer, lol. As it turns out, it's also *illegal* for her to be selling signals, as she isn't licensed.

She recently created a 'new' course, the Passive Income Class. $1,000 for 1-hour-ish of video content of her promoting her affiliate link for crypto dot com, once again. This course has now been *legally banned* for violating investment opportunities. Anna is very active on Insta playing the victim and taking no responsibility.

Lately, Anna has also resorted to hiring a VA from Fiverr (this is *strongly* suspected by many), to pose as a wildly successful course student.

[

Anna is highly narcissistic and possesses *zero* empathy for her paying course members.

**TLDR:** Pay $2K for very shoddy course, private Facebook group and signals channel. Course is duplicate videos with no real substance, terrible production, no TA or proper chart reading. No support from Anna in group, signals often careless. Voice opinions and concerns. Get booted from Facebook group and signals by tyrant Anna, course access possibly blocked too. **No refund.**

Meanwhile, she is referring to herself as a ""goddess"" and posting ""you can never be me."" Lol.

01/07/21,"Hello Redditors and BTC traders.

The recent run up in the price of bitcoin to $37,800 has become very over extended in my opinion.

Here's why:

1. The price of BTC has only had one major price pull back (drop) in the recent run up from $15,000 to current $37,400. (It dropped one major time when it pulled back from $34,800 to $28,000). 
2. Testing the $24K level is important because it was the only level above $20K that had reasonable resistance &amp; retesting significant levels increases investors' confidence about momentum &amp; trajectory. 
3. Typically when new ATH prices are set there's usually a 20% to 30% pull back immediately is following. These drops need to be happen for consolidation, profit taking &amp; determining a fair market value price with upside potential for new investors buying in. 
4. A few days ago I called for a pull back to $24K after it made the first $34,800 ATH price. It did have a brief pull back to 28K and then it ran back up again. If BTC price doesn't pull back to $24K, then I'm confident it will see a retest of $28K that we saw last week. 
5. The market cap for Bitcoin and the entire cryptocurrency is so over valued its a joke &amp; unrealistic hyped-up valuations. These ""digital assets"" are mostly useless yet have unjustifiable valuations.

01/08/21,"OK, click bait title. There will be dips but ....

There are lots of posts with people asking *when the next dip?,* or opining *dip back to $NK incoming*, or even *calling for a dip back to $NK* as if Bitcoin cares a flying f\*\*k for what you call for. The common thing behind them is, it happened last time so it will happen again. So, my hypothesis is **there will be no significant dips for a long time yet**.

Consider JP Morgan's recent statement:

*In a research note to clients, analysts at JPMorgan Chase predicted a  long-term bitcoin price target of more than $146,000 based on the  assumption that the cryptocurrency will grow in popularity as an  alternative to gold, which has traditionally been used as an inflation  and volatility hedge, as well as protection against a falling U.S.  dollar.*

*“A crowding out of gold as an ‘alternative’ currency  implies big upside for bitcoin over the long term,” wrote JPMorgan Chase  strategists led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou. However, “a convergence in  volatilities between bitcoin and gold is unlikely to happen quickly, and  is in our mind a multiyear process.*

*“This implies that the above  $146,000 theoretical bitcoin price target should be considered as a  long-term target, and thus an unsustainable price target for this year,”  they said*

First off, we don't need to argue about whether $146,000 is in any way correct (other than to believe that a price much larger than the current price is overwhelmingly likely), and we don't need to argue about whether anyone's trust in JPMorgan is sensible. All we need to take from this is that there are wealthy investors who believe with sufficient certainty that Bitcoin will be worth $146,000 at some point in the future.

Note also, JPMorgan do not say *price will rise to $146,000 and then crash back to .....* nor do they say *price will rise to $NK and then pull back to $146,000*. They are saying *in the long term BTC will be worth $146,000*. And, JPMorgan are not the only people saying this. Numbers and time periods may vary but the underlying message is the same: *in the long term BTC will be worth such-and-such amount* and that amount is much larger than the current price.

So, the people and organisations who believe this stuff are not going to be sitting there thinking *I'll wait for the next pullback* and neither are they going to see a 5% pullback and go *oh s\*\*t! sell! sell!*. On-exchange purchases will be done steadily to avoid burning though the order book and spiking prices, and dips might result in temporary speed-ups, but basically, once the decision is taken to start a purchase, it will run to its conclusion. There may be portfolio balancing sells from time to time, but the same applies, it will not be a panic reaction to some price change, it will be done in the same controlled way on the basis of deliberation or pre-defined strategies. Plus, these people are in for the long haul. Profits are nice, but diversification and hedging are at least as important, so they will not be significantly cashing out.

The demand for BTC is currently - and for a significant time to come - so dominated by these players that the days of 30% pullbacks are gone, at least until these buyers have loaded up their bags for the long term. So, grab the 10% pullbacks where you can, because those are all you are going to get.

01/09/21,"Hi all,

I’m a U.K. resident and the law regarding capital gains tax is as follows:

“They will be liable to pay Capital Gains Tax when they dispose of their cryptoassets.” I.e when you transfer from crypto to fiat you are liable to pay tax.

I was wondering what the best way to realise profits would be without paying tax?

What I mean is, let’s say I hold all my crypto in an exchange. I want to sell some BTC to take some of the profits made to date but don’t want to sell to fiat as I will have to pay tax. 

I was thinking maybe exchanging the BTC to a stable coin like Tether USD (USDT) and keeping that in the exchange so that if the price of BTC drops again I can accumulate without paying tax each time I sell crypto to fiat. 

Eventually I will take the profits out in fiat but for the mean time I still want to buy and sell a bit more.

01/09/21,"So I have held some GBTC in my Roth IRA for some time.  I’ve been overall pretty happy with the situation.   However, when I look at historical performance of GBTC, the variability of the premium worries me.  During the bull run of 2017, the premium touched 100% a few times.  And then during 2018 fell down close to 0% at some points.  

I am okay holding GBTC now during a bull market, but I would like to transition to something else prior to the next bear market, that way I can hopefully sell when the premium is substantial and just buy actual BTC in a crypto IRA.

I’ve investigated some options.  It seems like there are so called “checkbook IRAs” that allow you to open your own accounts with exchanges and purchase coins directly, which you could then transfer to cold storage and hold your own keys.

I’ve heard the downside of the checkbook type IRA is that you take on a lot of responsibility to do everything by the book and if you mess anything up you could compromise the status of your funds and could lose the tax protection afforded by an IRA or Roth IRA in my case.  

Another option available are few companies that offer crypto IRAs that have institutional custody of the coins.  You don’t get to hold the keys yourself, but there is less chance of screwing something up and causing a large taxable event. Companies here are bitcoinIRA (high fees, take percentage of your crypto every year), broad financial (better fee structure, but still taking a percentage of your holdings every year), itrustcapital (flat monthly fee, 1% of all trades, but no annual percentage), AltoIRA (similar time broad financial fees)

Of those three, based on fees only, itrustcapital seems like the only one that would be tolerable to me.  But I don’t know if any of those companies are really trustworthy.  I opened an account with itrustcapita and moved a small amount of money there to test out.  They have not been very responsive to me and it’s not possible to call them on the phone.  They make you take a phone call reservation two weeks in advance.  Not ideal if a problem ever comes up.  

Has anyone had experience with any of these companies or other alternatives?  I don’t think I want to take on the burden of the so-called checkbook IRA, but it is probably the most cost effective one and gives you the most control over your funds.

01/09/21,"While I want to believe that all of the recent price increases are because of institutional buyers, I have trouble reconciling it with the data.

[This graph shows that most of the money flowing into exchanges is Tether.] Tether is a convenience for being able to in effect exchange dollars on decentralized exchanges but should be unnecessary for an institution that can trade in good standing on any exchange that is actually a fiat gateway. If you're not going to trade on decentralized exchanges it's extra work -- you have to exchange your dollars for tether and then your tether for Bitcoin instead of just going straight from dollars to Bitcoin. Not only that, the tightest spreads are on the centralized exchanges.

r/Buttcoin keeps spreading the theory that Tether is engaged in a sort of Ponzi. The idea is that they print Tether without any dollars actually backing it, use those Tether to buy BTC, then claim they have ""dollars or *other assets*"" sufficient to back up the Tether they have printed. In other words they print say 100K Tether, then use it to buy 100K worth of BTC, then claim the new Tether is backed because of the BTC they are now holding. This creates a ""virtuous"" cycle -- print Tether, buy BTC to pump price, claim more Tether can be printed based on rising value of BTC holdings, repeat. Then dump for real dollars whenever you can get away with it.

I have read many people on here say that even if Tether is revealed to have problems, that there are alternative stable coins that will stand in and fill the same purpose. I understand that USDC and Dai maybe good alternatives for the official purpose of Tether, **but if artificial printing of Tether not actually backed by dollars is pumping the price of BTC, then the market switching to USDC or Dai will still end the pump**, presumably causing a price crash.

So do institutional buyers have any reason to buy with Tether?",0.035,0.882,0.083,0.9144
01/09/21,"Paint me stupid but does anyone have a firm grasp on how Grayscale Bitcoin Trust works?

Here's a 101 from Decrypt: [\[link here\]]

Quick read through, but far too vague. 'Shares in the fund track the price of Bitcoin, but only roughly.'

Roughly? Define roughly? Here's a link to a great list from [Bitcoin Treasuries] \- scroll down to see Grayscale.

Let's say that as of today - 1 share in Grayscale is at $44.2 an increase from approx $15 in Nov last year. It would seem to my eyes that the 'cost' of a share roughly mirrors the parabolic curve we've just been experiencing. Is it as simple as this? Will the cost of a share drop 'roughly' in line with the price of BTC? What happens if GS accumulate more BTC? Does this dilute the value or increase the value of a share?

01/10/21,"**Note:** This information will likely only be useful to anyone with a large amount of capital (~$40k-50k) they are looking to deploy towards a bitcoin strategy. If you have multiple bitcoins, you could sell one to put towards this.

**Background:** As you may know, the company Microstrategy ($MSTR) has been purchasing massive amounts of bitcoin. According to their [press release] on December 21st, they currently hold 70,470 bitcoins, worth approximately $2.78 Billion at time of this writing. Their market cap is worth $4.93B.

This admittedly is not a very efficient way to buy bitcoin (buying $1 worth of MSTR buys you $0.56 of bitcoin). *However*, since the time the company has started buying bitcoin, which was in [early August] the price of MSTR vs Bitcoin has been closely correlated, with a +/- range of about 18%, and since December 21st when they announced another purchase, it has correlated even closer, with a +/- range of about 7%. You can see the correlation by going on tradingview or something and charting MSTR/BTC.

Therefore, because MSTR has such huge holdings relative to market cap (over 50% right now), I'd consider this to be a decent proxy to buying Bitcoin. If the price goes higher, this correlation should only tighten, in my opinion.

**But WHY** would you buy MSTR instead of GBTC or bitcoin directly? MSTR has an options chain, GBTC does not. Bitcoin does have options available, even the regulated exchange in the US, LedgerX Omni. However, the chain there is extremely thin, and difficult to enter and exit positions. On LedgerX it's difficult to even buy a single full bitcoin's option contract without absurd slippage. On the other hand, MSTR has options provided by market makers on traditional exchanges. This means you have a super wide selection of strikes and expirations with not very large spreads. The open interest is not big, but the market makers are there. This also means you can do spreads.

**The Options Chain:** With volatility in the broader market (VIX) being higher than average at like 20, combined with MSTR's massive volatility because of bitcoin, this means their options premium is *hella expensive*. The share price right now is about $550 at close on Friday. ATM puts and calls just 5 days out to expiration are around $30 a share, or around 5% of the share price (IV @ 113%). The February expirations (40 days out) are around $85-$95 per share, or around 16% of share price (IV 127%). Out to July, it's ~$175 ATM or ~32% (IV 120%). Current IV is 93%.

**The Strategy:** Because volatility is so expensive, I think for a long term hodler the best play would be to actually SELL premium. Meaning, to go long you could SELL 1 put option, collect that premium. If the price goes up, you make money on the option expiring. If it goes down, you get a heavy discount. If you think bitcoin is peaking right now, well you can sell a put months or a year out, collect that massive premium, for a big discount. And if it just goes up instead, well you profit from keeping the premium. (If you REALLY want to make sure you get exercised, you can even sell a reasonably far ITM put).

Eventually if you get exercised, you can then sell covered calls against it again when you think we might be at the peak. Here's what's cool: The premium even for super far out of the money calls is still high. The highest strike for July I see is $830 (around 50% upwards), and the premium is $110. Times 100 shares that's $11,000! So let's say bitcoin doubles, and so does MSTR. You still capture the profit on the share price up to $830, plus the $11k. And if bitcoin doesn't go high enough to push the price past $830, in that time, you still get basically a 20% lower cost basis on what you hold! 

Another benefit to selling premium as opposed to buying it (in the case of cash-secured put or covered call), is if you sell a put to go long, it doesn't matter if the market makers later disappear, the option will still just exercise and you'll get in your long position. Alternatively, it could expire OTM without needing a market maker. If you are buying options, unless you have the capital to own the shares and exercise, you are at the mercy of a MM to exit.

If you are like me, who thinks it's possible bitcoin can run quite a bit from here, but aren't sure, and don't think it will likely more than ~2x (absolute max) or so this year from here, this could be a banger strategy. Save on the purchase by selling a put to go long, then ring the cash register selling super far OTM calls. 

And hey, if it does double and blow past your covered call strike, you can always cash out and buy straight GBTC with it to ride the rest of the way up.",0.019,0.866,0.115,0.9979

With the Biden administration coming in next week, one thing that we can expect is higher taxes. Especially with the amount of money that will be printed, you know the government will need a way to make it seem like they will be able to pay it off (even though it never will)

That being said, anyone that is new to bitcoin and Crypto, I advise you to start thinking about this now. Taxes on Crypto are Unclear but the IRS does not care, they STILL expect you to PAY YOUR TAXES. If this is going to be the bull run that everyone is claiming it will, then lots of millionaires will be made.

This also means that the IRS will start looking heavily into who is buying bitcoin and who is selling it.

Here are some Tips so you don't hate yourself when tax season comes.

1,) Track ALL transfers, buys, and sells: Currently no exchanges (that I know of) will give you any tax forms for whatever you traded throughout the year. If you are someone that trades a lot, you will be expected to keep track of all loses, gains and transfers yourself. The easiest way to do this will be to create an excel sheet of every time you bought crypto, what price you paid, what price you sold, when you sold, and the profit/loss you incurred. Keep track of this and your CPA will do the rest for how much you owe.

2.) Try not to trade too much: The more trades you make the more you will have to keep track of. If you are doing 10+ trades a day, that will add up fast. Unless you are willing to take the time to write those trades out, then you probably shouldn't make those amount of trades.

3.) Be carful trading BTC pairs: If you are trading BTC/USD pairs then everything will be simple. The second you start trading BTC/altcoin pairs, keeping track becomes VERY COMPLICATED. If you lose bitcoin on a BTC/altcoin pair, but bitcoin went up during that trade, thus the USD value of your account went up, THAT IS A TAXABLE GAIN. Not only is that a taxable gain, it is a taxable short term trade so you will be paying more taxes on the trade. This is one of the MANY reasons I believe trading bitcoin for altcoins is a horrible Idea.

After the last bull run, the IRS started sending out warning letters to people who didn't pay taxes on their crypto gains. This bull run I do not see them being as friendly. I expect them to start making examples out of the ones who try to not pay taxes on their gains regardless of how much you made. It is a well known secret in the Accounting industry that the IRS LOVES going after people who can not afford tax attorneys. It would be a shame for you to have to give up any gains you made trying to fight/ pay the IRS.

Lastly, there is one fool proof way of NEVER paying taxes on your bitcoin. That is to never sell. If you never make a USD profit, you will never get taxed. Just another reason to HODL. For all those that plan on taking profits and do not plan on paying taxes, I wish you the best of luck.",0.067,0.818,0.116,0.9896
01/13/21,"Hi, 

First, respect to the community, the hodlers, and the believers who are making BTC legitimate. You guys are great.

That said, I'm looking for advice/analysis on short term BTC investing. Most folks here are permabulls who advise buying at any price, because it's always discounted, because it will someday be worth a million dollars (even that is cheap, for some). Those who disagree get downvoted. 

This mentality may be fine and well for the long haul. However, I'm looking to make more liquid trades with BTC and take advantage of dips and tops that any asset experiences. Specifically, I'd like to discuss insight and guidance of realistic BTC price activity. For example, with every parabolic rally, we typically see a 40% correction. This has been the case since the early days. The recent pullback from $40k to $30k was only about 20%, so when is the true gap going to get filled? I'm waiting to take advantage of this. I buy low and sell high. Anyone else?

Again, I say this respectfully, yet pragmatically, because nothing goes straight up forever. Let's take advantage of that!

Thanks in advance.",0.03,0.79,0.18,0.9811

01/18/21,"With the stock market continuing it's bull run, it is clear that many people with no experience with investing are talking about how much money they are making. Now the point of this post is not to expose the hype in the market, but rather expose the emotions that come with these new investors. Anyone that has experienced a bitcoin bull run knows that making money is potentially the most addicting drug you can possibly try. And thanks to that stimulus check going directly to so many Robinhood accounts over this last year, there are probably more people addicted to the market than ever.

Now the thing is, what will happen if the stock market starts to go flat and the returns are average? Or when the profits starts going back into value rather than growth and tech companies? These new traders will still want their fix of dopamine from their account shooting up in value, but they won't be able to get this from tech stocks. Luckily, Robinhood has cryptocurrency and whether these new investors care about crypto or not, they will see bitcoin continuously going up. I believe this will be the catalyst to start the ""mania"" phase for crypto. Once these over-valued tech stocks start performing subpar, I expect the stock addicts to sell their stocks and buy bitcoin. This will push the price of Bitcoin and other altcoins up higher. We saw what they did to Tesla stock, and all the tech stocks that IPO'd this season. Just imagine what they could do to the crypto market. 

Of course, this is all speculation and anything could happen. But being involved in both crypto and the stock market, I am starting to see my unexperienced friends talk about stocks like people talked about crypto back in 2017. Considering that I expect Biden to stimulate the economy like never before, and for inflation to rise, I can not see a bear market happening in stocks or crypto anytime soon. At the same time, tech stocks are massively overvalued (IMO) and things can not go up forever. I think these same investors are also not willing to put in the work to understand financial statements to find the best value stocks. Bitcoin will offer these new stock investors high returns with the same buzz that tech companies have.

01/18/21,"A few weeks ago, [I made a post on how I expect bitcoin dominance to continue to rise] until it reaches 80% dominance.

However, I would like to suggest an alternative scenario: 

As you can see, we bounced off the 73% dominance mark, which served as resistance and support two previous times.  This suggests we could be forming an ascending triangle like formation.  The darker shade and lighter shade of blue on the above chart are the 50% and 75% width of the triangle.  This suggests we are getting near the breakout of the ascending triangle.

If bitcoin dominance continues to decline, then we are likely going to retest the ascending trendline of the triangle.  A bounce from that trendline at a similar angle as previous bounces would get us to 80% bitcoin dominance by early August, just in time for a late 2021 altseason.  It would literally be a repeat of 2017, but with increasing bitcoin dominance instead of decreasing bitcoin dominance.   

However, the past few weeks could also be a fake out, similar to the one that I circled in black.  

All in all, I think now is a good time to rebalance some bitcoin into altcoins to take advantage of a possible decline in bitcoin dominance.  If bitcoin retests the descending trendline, that would be a 5% decrease in bitcoin dominance.  For comparison, the last time bitcoin dominance decreased by 5% in June-August 2020, coins like LINK and AAVE increased in value 400-600%.  So some moderate altcoin buys are good risk reward.

**Today, to celebrate the insane Bull Market we’ve been having, I’m launching a special Bull Market mode, where you only trade the 30 hottest assets for the last Bull run since May 2020.**



I’ve handpicked the 30 hottest Crypto assets in the last months. Since November, most of them have increased somewhere between 100% — 400% with some outliers giving even higher returns.

BTC | ETH | DOT | ADA | LINK | BNB | UNI | AAVE | THETA | SNX | IOTA | YFI | COMP | AVAX | SUSHI | ZIL | WAVES | GRT | EGLD | RSR | LUNA  STX | ZEN | RUNE | BAND | TOMO | UTK | SRM | INJ | COTI 



Bull Market is a very special time and requires to get adjusted to new market tempo — way bigger runs and way more volatility.

Stops need to be bigger and profits need to be allowed to run much higher than we might usually anticipate.



&gt;**I’m releasing this mode so we all can get better adjusted to Bull Market conditions and be more in tune/sync with the crazy runs that are happening.**



To those that say “*you only really learn in live trading with real money where emotions are included*”:

Psychological factor matters, but multiple components contribute to success. I believe some can be trained in isolation with greater emphasis, like pattern recognition, figuring out entries/exits, stops/TP, etc. This app focuses on that.



To those that say “*there is already paper trading or demo mode in exchanges*”:

You learn infinitely faster with an app like this because you can fast-forward time.



To those that say “*this is Bull market, you just buy and hold*”:

First of all, even in the Bull market, you have to know when to exit, it will end eventually.

Second, try to compete with Buy&amp;Hold instead of just trying to be profitable. If you can’t beat Buy&amp;Hold, rethink your strategy.

Around 30 individuals have actually been officially charged in Japan with trading practically $100 million-worth of electronic properties while understanding they had actually been stolen 3 years back.



According to [a report] by Japan’s Mainichi on Friday, authorities in Japan declare individuals were located to have actually been trading NEM’s XEM cryptocurrency for various other cryptocurrencies using an illegal exchange on a darknet market.

The stolen cryptocurrency is a part of the $560 million-worth of XEM as well as various other cryptocurrencies siphoned off the Tokyo- based Coincheck exchange in an enormous January 2018 hack.

The 30 people are declared to have actually traded greater than 10 billion yen (US$ 96 million) based upon the currency exchange rate at the time of the burglary when XEM was around its all-time high of $1.6. Prices today are well listed below that at [around $0.21] according to CoinMarketCap.

Some of the suspects entailed in the apprehension supposedly traded their illegally traded electronic money for fiat money at numerous lawful exchanges in Japan as well as overseas, netting huge earnings.

The identifications of those that hacked Coincheck still stay unidentified.

The Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department will certainly quickly complete its probe right into those that traded the stolen symbols as the law of constraints is coming close to, according to Mainichi’s record.

01/24/21,"Inflammatory title, I know, but I am genuinely interested in the psychology of the ‘HODL’ gang. 

In finance there is a maxim - ‘everyone is a trader until their bet goes wrong; then they become an ‘investor’ holding for the long term’. 

With the extreme volatility of crypto it seems this maxim plays out far quicker than in normal markets. People want to get rich quick and then when volatility inevitably puts their position underwater they are suddenly HODL and exchange platitudes on forums with others stuck in the same position. 

My sub question would be- when is a HODL’er planning to sell? If they are true to the HODL concept, then surely ‘never’ is the only answer. Which seems ridiculous. 

Every good investor in it for the long term will have a set of conditions that will cause them to dump their investment. Recently W. Buffet dumped all his airline holdings at a significant loss. He had built his holdings over many years with the genuine desire to invest for the long term (or HODL, if you like). But he still had a set of parameters that would cause him to change his
mind. He sold for a large loss. 

The problem with the crypto HODL’ers is they seem to have no parameters on when to sell. In fact, the most logical parameter, such as a massive fall in price due to government regulation, actually seem to embolden the HODL crew. ‘It’s on sale’ ‘invest for the long term’.

01/25/21,"This is my opinion and what I'm basing my own personal investing decisions on.

IMO, Bitcoin is very likely to head for the moon in a *very* short timeframe - the question is when, and companies like Grayscale and Microstrategy are in the control room. It is an usual time in the world where the global economy has taken a big hit due to the pandemic which is ongoing and which will have lingering effects. For the first time in the history of crypto there has been real institutional interest and consolidation of BTC. BTC, as many high profile individuals have stated, could be used as a hedge against inflation but with far greater returns than any other asset available for that purpose as has been made evident from the recent rally. Furthermore, if more institutions were to consider Bitcoin in this way, *they could make it happen with more efficacity than they already have.*

It bothers me that this crucial point is rarely made: **trading in cryptocurrency is relatively** ***unregulated***\*.\* Crypto is not regulated by the SEC. Meaning that big money now being in the crypto market, a space where the price action has largely been moved by retail investors like you and I, are able to manipulate the price.

To me it makes sense that the rise to 40k was just a taste of what's to come in order to peak investor interest and to remind the world of what bitcoin was capable of. If the Dec-Jan rally was just a teaser, then the next logical step is to get as many investors on board before price takes off which means that the price of BTC would either have to stabilize or ***drop*** in order for the BTC trusts to consolidate as much of the market as possible before take off. If prices were to drop then whales and institutions (which could be considered the blue whales) are able to accumulate more BTC at a better price - this is what has been confirmed as statistics recently revealed that the amount of BTC in over 1K BTC addresses grew massively.

I felt very strange and suspicious a week ago when all of a sudden all of the news on BTC was bad, fueling massive amounts of FUD and creating a surrounding and compelling effect of negativity. All that would be needed to drive BTC price down for investor consolidation is for media outlets to put a negative spin on very ordinary, innocuous occurrences for a day and the selling of a significant sum of BTC to confirm emotional bias and set things in motion. Coindesk is owned by Grayscale and news today often has an agenda with institutional interest behind the scenes.

The disgusting and culpable reporting of the ""double-spend"" event has been proven to be exaggerated and very intentionally misnamed, Yellen made non-concrete comments about BTC which have been both good and bad and the seizure of apparently of the ""world's largest illegal darkweb marketplace"" was self-described by it's organizers as a ""small boutique marketplace"". Price went down, whale wallets grew. Now after all of that smoke has cleared, we're still where we were before the drop.

Microstrategy has it's investors conference on, I believe on Thursday the 23rd, something to take note of. Big money needs retail investors to raise prices and increase momentum on the market, they also need us to take our money when the time is right. The best period to capitalize on this would be in the short term to coincide with the U.S stimulus package and the general economic outlook. I'm not sure how much more manipulation will occur, but I know that it has been reported already by youtubers in the cryptotrading space so the word is out.

To be clear, I have a very cynical view of BTC's future in the mainstream, IMO it is very likely that big money are merely using BTC as a vehicle for their own gain and have no interest in the purpose of its creation, which is against their interest. Banks and nations are taking the technology of Satoshi's project which has its own vision and are incorporating it to fit their model, notable examples include China and JP Morgan. This is a scenario where the Bitcoin project and HODLr's lose but that will be a while away from now.

In sum I believe the price is going to skyrocket, but only with investor say so.  IMO if you are invested in BTC as I am, or are HODLing, keep doing so, if the price drops further, buy more. Big money will set the pace, but it is in their vested interest for price to go up at the time of their choosing, HODLr's and the like are only here for the ride. Again, this is my personal opinion at this point in time which has been come to through a fair amount of research. Any comments and counters, or if I got anything wrong would be greatly appreciated. In this case I would very much like to be wrong.",0.08,0.809,0.111,0.9794

Hi all,

Sorry for such a newbie post, but I hope some of you might be willing to help me out with some beginner tips! 

I am not new to Bitcoin and not completely new to trading, but have only ever done different types of arbitrage before as I am quite risk-averse. I am really interested in getting a feel for speculation though, so want to find some setups that may be suited to me so I can throw some small funds in and start to get feedback on what may or may not work for me. 

I guess the answer to the OP question is ""it depends on many things, including you"". But I wonder if there are certain setups or indicators that beginner day traders find easiest to get going with? 

Here are some things I am thinking about starting with and why I think it might (or might not) be good for me to start learning.

**Breakout**: Doing this on a smaller timeframe means higher # of trades per day to be able to get more feedback, collect data on results of trades to begin analysing. For this I am looking at volumes and points of resistance/support to decide when to open positions. I am wondering how I can get a solid grasp of historical data though (recent, e.g. past hours or day or so) and how significant volume was in failed support/resistance tests to get an idea of what position to open. MACD indicators I guess are also highly relevant to this setup.

**Scalping/Fading**: These seem so simple as to be good for beginners. What indicators are used to determine though whether sharp moves are the beginning of a trend that is to be continued, or whether something is really overbought/oversold and it is worth shorting after a big breakout upward, or going long after a big move downward? I guess this is the primary purpose of MACD, but I am wondering the best way/timeframe to use this with scalping/fading setups? 

*Question on MACD*: I am a bit confused about how to interpret/reconcile the dramatically different trends indicated on different timeframes by MACD (e.g. 1m, 3m, 5m, 15m, 1h point totally different directions). Intuitively it depends on the timeframe you are trading on, so if you are trying to open small positions and take profits quickly from one of the above strategies, are there certain timeframes where MACD is not so relevant to look at (I guess longer?). 

I am familiarising myself with certain common candlestick signals, trading the flag, etc., but basically just getting off the ground and beginning to take baby steps. 

Any advice on how to start as SIMPLY as possible to begin to get a feel for things as I then add more indicators and try out different setups/approaches would be much appreciated. Thank you!",0.017,0.864,0.118,0.9941

01/27/21,"Crypto has been pretty quiet lately, especially in comparison to the recent Reddit r/WallStreetBets and Robinhood spectacle of putting short squeezes on hedge funds who have received humongous cash bailouts and have exorbitant short positions on stocks. Though it seems like the situation has gotten under ""control"" by regulators and trading platforms suspending trading of certain stocks, it's becoming extremely apparent that the very establishment and rigged system of hedge funds manipulating markets to make a profit off retail traders, overleveraging to further manipulate markets, and then get bailed out by billions (or trillions) when things don't go their way is the same impetus for which Bitcoin was created. 

But what the Reddit and Robinhood communities haven't really understood yet is that they're playing a rigged game in a system that they are designed to have a disadvantage in. This is precisely the reason Bitcoin was created in 2008 following central banks failing and being bailed out to continue their errant ways; to create an entirely new system that is not controlled, governed, regulated, or supplied by central banks, federal reserves, or governments. I think once the Gamestop and AMC hysteria dies down, we may see a herd of disenfranchised retail stock traders who have recently had a taste of financial ability see the light that crypto has to offer and see how participating in crypto, e.g. buying Bitcoin, is trading fiat of a broken system and using it to buy into an entirely new system that is autonomous, trustless, decentralized, fungible, immutable, and cannot be shut down or suspended. Once that happens, and I think it's ""when"" not ""if,"" that should provide another new wave of buyers as Bitcoin continues to grow and gain market penetration among billions of bankless, underbanked, or otherwise taken advantage of in financial markets. 

This is an excerpt from my [Bitcoin daily analysis] but I feel like this is a very feasible scenario and possible catalyst for another wave of retail onboarding that could decisively terminate this current short-term correction.",0.088,0.832,0.081,-0.819

All responses are clearly automated. What pisses me off the most is that all this for no more than $30 worth of DOGE.

We have reached a point, imo, where Bitcoin no longer needs to drive the market, and may not be. Bitcoin could settle into a pattern of remaining between $30-$50k indefinitely, while we see other cryptocurrency reach 10+ (and even 100+) market caps as they are adopted.
Perhaps the most important adoptions that we can and will see will be digital currency to match a country's fiat, and adoptions by banks. Bitcoin will not be the tech that is used, not should it be.
BTC isn't going anywhere. But we will be seeing the gap get tighter now that the market has so much competition. And it's possible that BTC never needs to reach, say, $500k. It's one of many projects, and one with only so much use outside of a store of wealth.",0.016,0.888,0.097,0.9098

I’ve been working on a price model for the 2021 bull run.

The following is a purely educational exercise. I’m fitting models based on data and am probably wrong.

Here are the takeaways:

- Next local top in ~3 weeks

- It expects a 30% correction again from possible top of ~$70k

- Current predicted bubble top will occur June 30th, 2021 (+/- 15 days 95% confidence interval, see disclaimer below)

- Longer term (months): Price could reach up to $500k-$800k before bubble instability take over, although sufficient FUD could pop it sooner.

Date of collapse disclaimer: The predicted date of collapse will shift around as we get more data, so the confidence bound is based on current data and can not account for future price action. As we approach the true date, the predicted date will start to remain constant and the confidence interval will become more relevant, maybe. This date has ranged from April-Nov 2021 when running on earlier data, to give a flavor of the variability of this prediction based on available price data.

02/09/21,"According to Elliott Wave Theory's typical impulsive wave structures and lengths, it appears Bitcoin may have already completed its initial impulsive Wave 1 higher, rallying from roughly the $10,000 level up to just over $40,000 a few weeks ago. The subsequent \~30% correction which quickly followed, bringing Bitcoin down to just under $29,000 briefly, appears to have been Bitcoin’s W2 correction which has already completed as of a couple days ago. So where does that leave us now?

Likely at the start of Bitcoins impulsive W3 move higher. Impulsive Wave 3s are notorious for being the longest and most intense market waves in which bears turn into bulls because the trend is so strong. This is also the wave in which the greatest amount of profit is made following the trend. As you can see in the second chart [here] I have plotted a rough projection of Bitcoin’s long-term wave structure based on Fibonacci extension levels.

If W1 consisted of Bitcoin rallying from $10,000-$42,000, then this is now the start W3; of which W3s typically measure 1.618 to 2.618 of Wave 1. So, according to those ratios, if this Bitcoin W3 is 1.618 times the length of W1, then W3 would terminate around $94,000.

If Wave 3 was even longer and equal to 2.618 the size of Wave 1, then this W3 would extend all the way up to $126,000 before a significant correction. I tend to be of the opinion that Bitcoin will likely find heavy resistance around the $100,000 level, indicating a W3 top thereabouts, lining up well with a $94,000 W3 termination. 

Based on Pantera Capital's Dan Morehead and his $115,000 Bitcoin projection, I think this lines up fairly well with his model's price target, even if a blowoff top hits $126K (or even higher) - which frankly no one would mind one bit.",0.02,0.902,0.078,0.9426
02/11/21,"After ADA's massive run up I noticed the funding rate on ADA/USDT perpetual futures is massive, 0.2625% /8hr (there's also a fat premium over the spot price in there to collect too), however the funding rate on the ADA/BTC pair is a much more tame 0.01%. I feel like there has to be a way to make money on the funding rate without being exposed to the price movements of ADA. So I want to short ADA/USDT and long ADA/BTC however this leaves me short BTC/USD (I think). For example, if I just short ADA/USDT, and long ADA/BTC if bitcoin runs up the trade blows up in my face.

So the solution is to long some number of BTC/USD contracts. My question is what is the optimal way to set this up so I maximize profits and don't get liquidated on any legs of the trade?

02/13/21,"TL;DR: 
Last week’s predictions have played out as expected so far. Couldn’t predict Tesla’s big announcement, but in retrospect it was inevitable. 40k euro resistance is futile!

-Pullback expected after a local top around $60k at the beginning of March. This has not changed since last week.

-The bull cycle model predicts we will not go below $40k until this cycle is over with 99.73% confidence (3 standard deviations). If price breaks below this level model is invalidated.

-The predicted crash dates are moving further back as predicted, indicating the current price action is healthy. Current critical date bull cycle end is end of August 2021 (pushed back from end of June 2021 last week).

-Other adoption analysis from @woonomic combined with my analysis suggests the fundamental price floor may rise faster than expected (possibly 90x price in ~5 years?).

-At writing time, the LPPL-autoregressive model predicts we’re at $47.2k, in the expected price range of $43.8k-$51.0k. The true price was $47.1k. The model predicts an expected price range of $44k-$56k tomorrow, and $51.5-$66.8k this time next week.

In the post I talk a bit more about the LPPL model, the assumptions it makes, and link to other analysis made during the 2017 bull run that used LPPL and predicted the date of the top.

I would like to remind readers this post is a purely educational exercise. I’m fitting models based on data and am probably wrong. Don’t construe this analysis as investment advice, I am not an investment advisor and you should seek one out before making decisions with your money.

02/14/21,"After the latest wild ride took the poster child of cryptocurrencies above $40 000 before a stomach-churning plunge, the million dollar question won't go away: how much is bitcoin actually worth?
The virtual currency barreled to new highs to rise more than 400 percent over the past year, before promptly sliding some 20 percent and then settling around $36,000.

When it started life in 2009 as open-source software, bitcoin was essentially worth zero -- though within a year it had reached the heady heights of eight cents.

At today's market rates, bloated by a surge in institutional demand, the digital unit's market capitalization is worth some $670 billion with myriad other crypto coins such as Ethereum lifting the sector nominally close to the trillion mark.

Although that's small potatoes compared to the $68 trillion or so swilling around world stock markets, it is nonetheless the sort of financial territory staked out by Wall Street tech royalty such as Google, Apple or Tesla.
One tech site, AssetDash.com, notes that bitcoin is currently worth around as much as Facebook and a little more than Chinese e-retail giant Alibaba.
Although deep-pocketed investors have recently become enthusiasts, crypto was in its early days the preserve of geeky amateur investors.

It is the latter who have mainly suffered as an estimated four million of the roughly 19 million bitcoin units currently in circulation have been lost.

""Lost"" does not mean the coins have fallen down the back of the sofa or through a hole in a trouser pocket: they have been electronically zapped from the record, often because their owner has forgotten a password to coins hoarded on a USB stick.
One US developer mislaid his password after storing 7,002 bitcoins on one such flash drive, forcing him to wave goodbye, on paper (or rather, the trading screen), to around $280 million.

This week, Welshman James Howells desperately offered his local authority a quarter of his fortune to dig up a landfill site where he believes a hard drive he accidentally tossed away -- and which has since soared in value to around $270 million -- is buried. The council refused, citing the cost and logistical restrictions.

According to analysts at JP Morgan, bitcoin may be highly volatile but could go as high as $146,000 per unit, putting it in competition with gold as an asset class in terms of private sector investment.
That volatility, as well as the unregulated and decentralised nature of the bitcoin beast, are key reasons why many seasoned financial observers are scared off -- as well as the risk of ""losing"" their stash.

""Most of the lost bitcoins were acquired in the early days,"" said Philip Gradwell, economist with Chain lysis.

Gradwell said that around one in five bitcoins in circulation today have not budged from their location in five years -- since days when the unit was worth not much more than $100.

""One or two million of those belong to Satoshi himself,"" added Gradwell, referring to the creator of the coin, whose identity remains unknown.

He added that the bulk of investors are not day-to-day traders, but people making a long-term punt -- and he estimates that the spectacular price boom of recent weeks has involved only around five millions units.
Patrick Heusser, head of trading at Swiss trader Crypto Broker, said that following the trading volumes of a variety of cryptocurrencies, rather than just bitcoin, would give a better idea of how the market is faring.

""Ethereum has a lot of activity on the chain, but on the lite coin side there is almost nothing going on,"" said Heusser, with the former valued at some $138 billion currently, and the latter at $10 billion.

Heusser suggested the rises have been largely a bitcoin slipstream effect, and he cautioned against drawing parallels with gold.

""To be honest I don't believe that it is a very powerful or insightful metric inside what's going on in the crypto market,"" Heusser concluded.

After years of experience on traditional currency markets, he judged that it was early days for the crypto equivalent.

I have the following plan: 

On Deribit, I sell one BTC-31Dec21 Call option, strike 100k USD. This gives me around 11,500 USD ""profit"" right now. The call is fully secured with 1 BTC, so if by end of December BTC is at 50k, I have 11,500 USD more than I would otherwise have. If BTC is at 200k, then I would have 111,500 USD, and one BTC less. 

So basically free money while 100% achieving my goals, right?

But I am GREEDY! Let's say in June BTC goes to 90k USD, but Dec futures are already at 100k USD. Now I want to ""lock in"" the 100k price and sell the Dec future for 100k, which I will collateralize with my second BTC. The first BTC is still collateralizing the call option I sold. 

Scenario 1: BTC is at 50k on 31st Dec 2021: I sold 1 BTC via futures for 100k, pocketed 11.5k from selling the call option which didn't get executed, and still have 1 BTC. --The plan worked perfectly. 

Scenario 2: BTC is at 200k on 31st Dec 2021: I sold 1 BTC via futures for 100k, pocketed 11.5k from selling the call option. But now the call option got executed and I had to deliver 1 BTC for 100k. So I have 211.5k USD and 0 BTC. BAD. 

  
Is there a way to lock in the 100k future price while simultaneously ""harvesting"" $$ via selling covered calls? Or is it one or the other?

02/16/21," Hello,

I have around 30k Euro savings and I would like to have it increased. I was always curious about Bitcoin and cryptocurrency for a possible method to increase your wealth but I never really got serious about investigating and look at my possibilities for myself until very recently.

Finally last week I decided to open an account in Binance and, after a period of verifying my account, I can now use it for buying/selling/exchange cryptocurrency (CC). Yesterday I also created an account in Exodus so as not to have my money in the Binance wallet because I want to have more control of my assets than keeping it at Binance.

Of course, I wasn't going to just go crazy and exchange my different 30k Euro savings on different CC. What I did yesterday was to first buy around 50 Euro on BTC, and later I also bought around 40 Euro on Ethereum (ETH) and finally around 36 Euro on Dogecoin (DOGE). This was only for me to learn the dynamics of the market and allow me to play and understand the risks of playing with crypto money. I want to let this money to rest for a week or so and see if it grows and for how much. Later my intentions are to maybe buy something around 500 Euro on each of these three options and repeat the process. Once I feel more confident, maybe land some more Euros on BTC and possibly also ETH.

However, my first impressions of this experiment are not so positive. If I want to buy crypto on Binance with a debit card I first need to transfer cash to the app which could come with a commission of 1.3 Euros sometimes, and later, to transfer that crypto money to your Exodus wallet comes with further fees from Binance. At the end of my initial investment of yesterday (50+40+36=126 Euro), I only can see something around 83 Euro on my Exodus wallet. I know this was a simple experiment for me with little money and that it has just passed a day but that's 43 Euros of loss!

Therefore, I have a couple of questions:

1. Do you see my approach as good practice? Or am I doing something wrong?
2. What do you recommend me to do for growing my 30k savings, reach FIRE and see my savings grow via CC?
3. Would it be ok to expect that in the next month these 83 Euros on different CC will grow and pay off this loss of 43 Euros?

**1. Trading is hard. And can be very stressful.**   If you're looking for easy money, this is not the way.  If you're susceptible to strong emotions, this is not the way. With that said, I'd like to give you a few tips that **may** help trading be fun.

**2. There will always be another trade and another opportunity.**  
Crypto is 24/7. This is a lot of fun when you realize everyone on WSB has to stop trading at 4pm. This is awful once you realize that everyone on WSB **GETS** to stop trading at 4pm. You will feel pressure to watch the price **all the time**. 

There will always be another trade and another opportunity. Make sure to make time for the important things in life outside of trading. Family, friends, health, sleep, food, etc. Seriously make sure you sleep well. Crypto is notorious for not letting you sleep.

**3. 7PM EST / 12am UTC is a crucial time**  
A large portion of Europeans have just closed their daily candle. It's 8am in Beijing which is the beginning of the work day for many. 4pm on the west coast which means people have just finished work. And dinner time on the east coast so people have time to pay attention. There are several hand off periods throughout the day but 7pm est seems to be one of the most crucial. I also find 2am. EST and 7am. EST to be very important hand off moments where one continent hands of control of the markets to the others.

**4. Revenge trading / trading on emotion is the quickest way to blow up your account.**  
Forget about winning back the money you just lost, it's gone. Don't throw good money after bad. Take a walk, get something to eat, take a nap, have sex, whatever. But definitely do not continue trading unless you are calm and collected. Never trade angry, upset, sad, or anxious, you won't think straight. You need to be in control of your emotions.

**5. Only risk what you can afford to lose.**  
I think every trader has blown up their account at some point. Make sure it won't be a crippling blow when it happens.

**6. You should never risk more than 1% or 2% of your total bankroll on any 1 trade.**   
Your position size is probably too big. It only takes 1 bad trade to get rekt, you can't put yourself in that position. Even the best traders have win rate of 60 - 75%. If you're just starting you're probably somewhere in the 15 - 30 % range. So just work it out logically. If for every big win you're taking 2 or 3 big losses you are gonna blow up your account fast. If you can't take 50 losing trades in a row, your positions are too big.

**7. The goal of trading is not to get big wins, it's to manage your risk, protect your capital, and grind out wins over time.**  
Rarely will you call the perfect top or perfect bottom. Wait for the market to show you its intentions, seize the opportunities that present themselves, take your profit, and be happy. But above all else, always manage your risk, that's the key.

**8. Your position size is based on your stop loss, not the other way around.**  
Most people decide on a position size and then pick a SL level to limit how much money they can lose; this is backwards. Stop loses should be based on TA, not arbitrary levels like ensuring you only lose $x. Decide your stop loss before you enter, then adjust the size of your position so that if it gets hit, it will be an acceptable amount of loss.

**9. The outcome of any 1 trade is always random.**  
Your analysis might be wrong, some unknown news might come out, Elon might tweet against you, etc. (This seemed a lot more prophetic when I originally posted it a week ago, before the doge tweets). It's only over time your edge plays out. It might take 100 trades or more before you know if your system is successful. Your bank roll need to last long enough to get the law of averages to play out. Which brings me to...

**10. For now, you should only be taking absolutely optimal trade set ups.**  
If the set up is not optimal because for example, you just got stopped out and now it's pumping; you can't fomo in! You missed that move, sit on the sidelines until you have another optimal opportunity. Even trying to catch a move that's only half played out will reduce your winnings by half and double your risk.  

**11. Plan the trade and trade the plan.**  
You need to know all the details before you click the button. What is your entry? Where is your exit? Where is your stop loss? You need to know all of that in advance. We have a tendancy to let our losers run too long because we want losing trades to break even, avoid the temptation to widen your stop. Likewise we have a tendancy to cut off our winners short because we want to lock in the gain. Once you're in the trade you may get emotional; defer to the decisions you made while you were thinking clearly and never fault yourself for a decision made with a clear mind, even if it doesn't go your way.

**12. Be aware of your biases**  
We all have a tendancy to lean one way or the other. People who are bullish will interpret the chart bullishly and look for reasons to justify their desire to go long. Same for people who are bearish. Be aware of what your biases are and do your best to negate them. Take what the market gives you, not what you expect it to give you.

**13. The hardest trade to take is no trade at all**  
It's hard sitting on your hands but over trading is an absolute account killer.

**14. A successful day is not a day when you make money, it's a day where you follow your plan precisely.**  
Sometimes you'll win, sometimes you'll lose, over time it will average out. A successful day is not one of the days you make money but one where you are disciplined enough to follow your plan. No bad setups, no fomo, no wasted bankroll. If your system is good you will win over time.

If over time your system isn't successful then you can make changes but If you're constantly changing your approach just cause, you're just gambling, and probably falling victim to recency bias.

**15. You can make money in a rising or falling market.**  
As a long time hodler i hope the market goes up. But as a trader I don't care. All I want is volatility. As long as the price is moving, you can profit off of it, whether it's rising or falling.

**16. Learn about liquidity pools and stop hunting.**  
A piece of advice I never forgot is ""If your stops keep getting hit right before the market reverses, congratulations, you've figured out where everyone else is putting their stops. Learn to use it to your advantage.""

**17. Start with a really small amount or better yet, get a practice account.**  
You need to reduce the size of your bets to something insignificant while you're still learning. You'll want to take big bets to feel like you are making money. Don't do that. You will suck at first. Really bad. You should be risking $10 per trade for now while you learn. Once you have a win rate above 50% and can consistently win your $10 trades, then you can think about upping your position size. Better yet, make yourself a practice account and get good with fake money before using real money again.

**18. Keep a trading journal!**  
Seriously this is so important. When you have a record of your trades along with your thoughts before, during, and after the trade you can review them and start to notice patterns. Strategies that work, strategies that don't, patterns that stress you out, how your state of mind, lack of sleep, temperament, etc, affects your trading. You need data to improve, and if you don't have a journal, you don't have the data you need to measure and improve. You need to study your wins and losses so you can learn from them.

02/16/21,"Two places are really struggling with crypto initiatives right now. Hong Kong and India are facing cryptocurrency bans. The Hong Kong government is planning to restrict trading for professional investors. The proposal of this law appeared as a part of Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing measures. It will be introduced to the legislative council later this year. The representative of the Bitcoin Association warns that this initiative goes against the government’s goal to promote innovations.

In India the Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill was introduced in January. Experts believe that in this case the law will affect individuals less. However, it will definitely slow down the development of the financial sector of the internet in the country.

02/16/21,"TLDR:  I did a Monte Carlo simulation of the natural log of the daily closing price of BTC modeled as a random walk.  Over a 50-day horizon, it looks like this:



Based on this model, there's a 50% chance that on any given day, the price will fall within the smaller window (dashed lines), and a 95% chance it will fall within the larger window (solid lines).


**Details**:

Data:  I started with the historical daily closing price from Coindesk, dating back to Sept. 30, 2013.* Here's what a plot of the natural log of the data looks like:



Next, I differenced the series -- i.e., I calculated the daily change in the log of the price by subtracting the log of the price on Day X from the log of the price on Day X+1.  That looks like this:



So far, it looks reasonably like noise to me. Note that the average daily change in the log(price) is 0.002223368, corresponding to a daily increase of about 0.22 percent.  Note that it is NOT normally distributed, however.  (I can post some graphs showing that if anyone cares.)

To check for any departures from the noise assumption, I plotted the autocorrelation function with a lag out to 15 days, which looks like this:



The estimated correlation coefficients are pretty close to 0 at all lags, so that looks reasonably like noise.  There is some possible positive correlation at day 6 and 10, but it's probably not totally crazy to model this as noise.  

Next, I constructed my Monte Carlo simulation. (This is just a fancy term for ""computer simulation with random draws run many times over"".)  Each ""trajectory run"" goes like this:  Start with the log of the closing price at the end of today (Feb 16 at 4 pm EST), and simulate the trajectory going forward by randomly drawing from the historical daily changes, going day-to-day for 50 days into the future.  So it's just:  Price at Day X+1 = Price at Day X + (random draw from historical daily changes), all done in the logs.  I used simple random sampling with replacement, giving us a random walk. The average value of the historical daily changes is positive, so the trajectories have a tendency to drift upwards.

To give you an idea what it looks like, here's a plot of five random trajectories simulated in that fashion:



Then, I simulated 10,000 such trajectories.  To get the forecast windows, I just calculated the percentage of the times that a trajectory on a give day falls within the windows (i.e. for each day, I found the 2.5th, 25th, 75th, and 97.5th percentiles of the simulated prices for that day.)

NB:  Although the windows are drawn with lines, it does NOT mean 50% of trajectories stay within the dashed lines, or that 95% of trajectories stay within the solid lines.  The proper interpretation of the envelopes is:  On any given future day, there's a 50% chance (or 95% chance) that the price will fall within the envelope lines.

*Edit to add: I think there may be some small gaps in the Coindesk data, but they probably don't have a significant effect on the results. Next time I'll do this forecast, I'll figure it out.",0.01,0.9,0.09,0.9878

I want to trade XLM on the daily timeframe, and I'd like to base my entries and exists based on technical analysis (trend lines, support and resistance, etc). However, these lines are completely different depending on which chart I'm looking at: XLMBTC or XLMUSD.

There might be a line of resistance on the XLMBTC chart which simply doesn't exist on XLMUSD. This seems like the TA simply won't work if most traders are looking at a different chart to me.

02/17/21," A launch day as well as activation timeline are established for Bitcoin’s Taproot upgrade, yet programmers as well as various other stakeholders are still questioning the very best approach to coordinate Bitcoin’s most significant upgrade considering that SegWit.

Per [a public IRC chat] conversation, the code for the totally primed-and-ready Taproot upgrade will certainly be released at some point in between March 17 as well as March 31 (or April if needed), yet the real signaling that kick-starts the activation procedure most likely will not begin till July.

If every little thing [goes as planned] after that Bitcoin’s “economic majority” (miners as well as node drivers that run Bitcoin’s code) can upgrade within 2 weeks of the signaling duration’s beginning. Come August 2022, Taproot’s activation duration will certainly reach its timeoutheight  
 as well as signaling will certainly finish.

Assuming mining swimming pools showing 90%+ of Bitcoin’s hashrate assistance Taproot prior to the timeoutheight  
 (as one study shows), after that the huge bulk of assistance would certainly guarantee Taproot is a success, as well as the various other 10% or two (the “economic minority”) can upgrade without effect later.

But what occurs if the mining swimming pools *do not* signal to turn on Taproot? Well, that’s where the problem is in conversation now. But for several of Bitcoin’s stakeholders the problem should not also exist.

## True or incorrect?

First, a fast note regarding Bitcoin upgrades.

Unlike a central network, whose main drivers can mandate an upgrade whenever as well as nonetheless they select, Bitcoin’s network is decentralized, so upgrades call for purposeful decision-making as well as conversation amongst Bitcoin’s stakeholders (specifically, programmers, miners, organization as well as power customers). Taproot is a “soft fork,” suggesting an adjustment that works with previous variations of the software application (unlike a “hard fork,” where more recent rule-sets as well as older rule-sets are inappropriate).

Soft fork or otherwise, at the heart of the issue for triggering Taproot is whether to offer node drivers (those people running Bitcoin’s resource code) an alternative to pressure turn on the upgrade if a supermajority of miners fall short to sustain it prior to the timeout.

This would certainly permit node drivers to turn down blocks from miners that do not sustain the upgrade. This kind of action (a supposed “user-activated soft fork”) was utilized to prod along the SegWit upgrade activation in 2017 as well as is thought to have actually moved the [Overton window] for miners to approve the upgrade.

The various other alternative is to not include this attribute whatsoever. These Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) alternatives to pressure or otherwise require the upgrade are referred to specifically as BIP8 (real) as well as BIP8 (incorrect), additionally called WHOLE LOT= real as well as WHOLE LOT= incorrect. WHOLE LOT is brief for lockinontime  
, a function that determines whether Taproot will certainly be “locked in” if network-wide activation isn’t gotten to when the timeoutheight   
is gotten to; the (real) alternative instantly mandates the upgrade after the activation home window runs out, while (incorrect) allows it fall short totally.

Opponents of BIP8 (real) state this hostile action is unjustified since Taproot isn’t in jeopardy of stopping working. As [Bitcoin] Core factor Andrew Chow placed it, with the [Taproot activation survey sent to miners] “the community has already decided to activate, \[so\] there’s no need to \[do\] LOT=true. Miners are part of the community.”

## Could Taproot activation trigger a Bitcoin chain split?

Still others in support of BIP8 (real) think it is a needed attribute for collaborating the upgrade, which in the rarer situation of severe discoordination, can divide the Bitcoin network right into inappropriate variations if something fails.

“LOT=true does not split the chain. It strictly reduces the likelihood of that,” BIP8 (real) main advocate Luke Dashjr claimed in the conversation.

Dashjr shares this sight with others, like hsjoberg, that kept in mind, “Lot=true would make sure upgraded nodes mandate a specific chain.” This implies that node drivers that run real would certainly mandate that the Taproot- turned on variation of Bitcoin is the “real” chain, so in theory this would certainly aid collaborate agreement in between stars to prevent a split.

One brg444 competed that “if lot=true activates there will be a network split.” But this would just be if the forced activation underwent. Brg444 claimed they believe this is not likely, since the hazard of this actual split would certainly suffice to scare miners right into triggering prior to the forced activation happens.

## The ghost of SegWit past

But is a scare technique truly needed or is it an outright program of pressure?

“\[In my opinion, people\] have PTSD from SegWit … \[they’re\] being preemptively defensive for seemingly no reason other than they’re afraid of past events that now seem to have a low probability of actually occurring,” Lightning Labs CTO Olaoluwa Osuntokun claimed in the conversation, referring to miners initially opposing the activation of SegWit.

“\[P\]pl are just shadow boxing casper rn lol,” he claimed later on. “Let’s give \[BIP8 (false)\] a shot and revise afterwards if stuff actually happens.”

After all, if 6 months or two after activation starts miners have not signified for Taproot, after that WHOLE LOT= real can be coded in after the reality to impose the upgrade.

Still, this would certainly include yet one more action to the procedure, as well as making this modification post-factum would certainly be much more troublesome than simply including it in the first launch. But some believe it’s a much more sensible choice, particularly taking into consideration the preconception that brand names Bitcoin advancement as a shut yard that is subject to the often tending of programmers just.

“LOT=true appears as if the developers are forcing a change upon the community. While that may not necessarily be the case, the appearance of that happening is not a good thing. Given that we don’t believe there will be any issues with activation, I would prefer LOT=false to avoid this view,” Chow claimed.

## An inquiry of sychronisation

Notably, the last conference to talk about Taproot appeared to suggest bulk assistance for WHOLE LOT= incorrect. With just 100 or two participants this round (as opposed to virtually double the participation last time), as well as some support expanding for WHOLE LOT= real, however, “we can’t really measure ‘community consensus,’” factor Darosoir claimed.

According to the Taproot activation wiki, 26 participants in the other day’s conference vocally preferred WHOLE LOT= incorrect while 19 preferred WHOLE LOT= real (some even more neutral celebrations showed they would certainly be great with either).

Hardly agent of Bitcoin’s vast worldwide neighborhood, the IRC babbles left the conference without clear agreement on the specific activation specifications, with some articulating the demand to simplify the intricacies of the procedure to obtain a much more enlightened point of view from the broader neighborhood.

“I will say, though, that I think this discussion would have benefitted from having a more clear view of the community overwhelmingly supporting this. Off topic for this meeting, but anyone interested in how to get better data around this, I’d be interested to work with,” Keagan McClelland, founder of Start9 Labs, created in the conversation.

With a day established for completion of March as well as the mass of the activation specifications picked in BIP8, the last concern to solution for Taproot’s release is whether to consist of the “user activated soft fork” action from the beginning or otherwise.

Taproot will certainly deliver by BIP8 in late March as well as activation is slated for July, so this concern will certainly have to be addressed within the month.",0.062,0.822,0.116,0.9964
02/17/21,"Listen up folks,

Most of us were here in 2017.  After the crash in 2018, we dreamed of another bull run, but deep down many wondered when or if it would come.  It was pretty clear that the dumb money who got burned by vaportokens and ICO's was not going to return with the same irrational exuberance from 2017.  We knew the next bull run would need a different fuel.

2017 was the bull run where crypto pretended to be Silicon Valley.  You saw a lot of ridiculous justifications on why certain businesses needed to be put on the blockchain.  Even more absurd was that they needed their own blockchain and token.  It felt very reminiscent of the 90's tech bubble, because you had this promising technology (blockchain) being used to hype up new projects.  It became a frenzy and many of us participated while simultaneously realizing the entire ICO sector was a joke.

This new bull run is much different.  It's not characterized by vaporware and anonymous Russian crypto tokens pretending to Silicon Valley 2.0.  This bull run is the result of the growing belief that cryptocurrency is an investable asset class and warrants a consideration for allocation in every well-rounded portfolio.

It comes at a unique point in time, where interest rates are 0 and fiat currencies are being printed at truly unprecedented levels.  10Y Treasuries are yielding just above 1%.

[

[

People are absolutely flush with \*cash\* but there's very little places to put that cash.  The stock market, especially in the US, and especially the tech sector, is trading at record valuations &amp; multiples.  

[

[

Many call it a bubble and expect a crash on equities (and BTC).  However, a crash means that people are desperately selling assets in return for fiat currency.  Once they have that fiat currency, there is no way to earn income on it, because interest rates are 0.  And the Fed/Treasury has shown it is more than willing to print money in any major downturn, diluting the value of fiat.

So why would investors take the major risk of holding cash in a downturn?  They would be heavily incentivized to buy a dip in equities, because once again, there's hardly anywhere else to allocate investment.  Sure, real estate is another option.  Guess what, real estate is booming too.  Home prices are up 8.4% over the past year, and are forecast to grow another 10.5% this year, according to Zillow:

[

So both equities and real estate are at all time highs.  How about metals?  Shouldn't Gold and Silver be in a bull market?  Interest rates are near 0, Fed is printing money.  This is the shocker.  Following the 2008 crash, gold and silver went on a magnificent run, under similar conditions to today.  It seemed like it was happening again this summer, as gold hit an ATH and went past the $2000 mark.  But then, something changed.

[

Sometime in October 2020, BTC completely flipped the switch on Gold and went from 5.7 oz per BTC to 28.12 oz per BTC.  It really is quite significant, because Gold &amp; Silver would normally be a great hedge against the risks we see in today's markets.  This chart is suggesting that BTC is the new and improved version of Gold.  

[

In 2008, after the markets bottomed, gold went on a crazy run.  It bottomed around 700/oz and topped out above 1800 in 2011.  Nearly a 2.5X throughout the recovery from the Financial Crisis.  Compare that to the recovery from the COVID March crash, where gold went from $1500 to $2000, roughly a 33% gain from its bottom, and it's now down to below $1800.  

So how does this all relate to portfolio allocation and Bitcoin?  Well, portfolio managers are looking for ways to provide return on capital.  Traditional asset allocation would be a mix of:

\- Stocks

\- Bonds

\- Treasuries

\- Precious Metals

\- Cash

\- Real Estate

Stocks &amp; Real Estate are at all time highs.  Metals are apparently being ""replaced"" by cryptocurrencies.  Cash is being diluted and devalued.  Bonds and treasuries return very little due to low/zero interest rates.  So you see the conundrum for asset managers.  They have trillions of dollars to allocate.  Worldwide wealth is estimated @ $360.6T.  USA alone is estimated around $105.9T.

[

Wealth seeks investment.  The majority of people's money does not get spent on yachts, cars, and private planes.  It sits in a portfolio with the purpose of appreciation.  Traditional portfolio allocations are being turned on their heads, because major asset classes provide returns below inflation (bonds &amp; treasuries).  Where the hell are people going to put all their money?

That is what is behind this recent cryptocurrency boom.  And that is why \*this time it's different™\*.  Cryptocurrency is a revolutionary new asset class which excels in periods of uncertainty, low interest rates, and the potential for high inflation.  Bitcoin's market cap of $965.5B represents less than 0.26% of worldwide wealth, and less than 10% of Gold's market cap.  

Currently, you are hearing many portfolio managers mentioning putting 1-2% of a portfolio into BTC.  This is a breakthrough, because it signifies that institutions and large-scale portfolio managers are treating this like a real asset class worthy of allocation.  As cryptocurrency becomes more accessible and cemented in portfolio management, it is conceivable for this allocation to move closer to 5%.

Imagine portfolio allocations of 5% on worldwide wealth.  Suddenly you're talking about levels around $16.8T, or somewhere above $850K per BTC.  Do I think it's going to happen anytime soon?  No, that would be irrationally optimistic.  But you can see the types of value we are looking at here.  And none of these valuations or allocations depend on black swan events like the collapse of the USD.  

TL;DR Bitcoin is becoming increasingly accepted as an asset class worthy of allocation in investment portfolios.  This could drive price growth to levels that would initially seem inconceivable.

02/22/21,"Bitcoin’s (BTC) price has been grinding up nicely over the past few weeks, but the past 24 hours have seen a significant correction. BTC price dropped by over $10,000 from $58,000 to under $48,000, a correction of almost 20%.

This pullback — which many anticipated as 28,000 BTC was deposited to Gemini — also caused other cryptocurrencies to fall alongside Bitcoin, resulting in Bitcoin's market dominance rising as a result.

But will history repeat and produce a dull, corrective March? Let's analyze the charts. 

Bearish divergence implying further downside to come


Markets never go up in a straight line, and corrections must occur from time to time. This can be considered a ""reset"" for the market, which reverts back to the mean trendline, and the euphoria fades.

At the first stage of a correction, people still expect the corrective move to be a tiny correction, while the sentiment slowly starts to shift. The moment the correction continues, the lower the price goes, the worse the sentiment becomes.

At the bottom, Bitcoin will be called ""dead"" and a Ponzi scheme once again, after which the price has historically recovered.

The critical question now, however, is whether the market will see a prolonged correction or if Bitcoin’s price will hold above the green box shown in the chart above. That green box is the previous period of compression that technically should serve as major support.

If the area between $42,000 and $44,000 holds, upward continuation is likely. In that case, the point of interest at $63,000 is still on the table.

However, the bearish divergence and the weakness at the start of this week suggest more downside is possible. In that regard, losing the $42,000–$44,000 area could result in a further correction toward $37,000. 

March historically isn’t a bullish month


The weekly chart for Bitcoin shows some beautiful historical data, which shows that March tends to be a period of correction or consolidation. Massive corrections happened in 2017, 2018 and 2020 during this period, while 2016 and 2019 saw sideways price action.

Of course, history is not guaranteed to repeat, but history rhymes, and historical data often provides insight into how market cycles work.

In that regard, the critical indicator to watch is the 21-week moving average (MA), which should hold Bitcoin’s price from dropping further. From that perspective, the current price level of the 21-week MA is found at $28,000, and this will crawl up to $32,000 to $34,000 in the coming weeks.

Thus, the recent higher low is created at $30,000, which means that a further drop toward $38,000 to $40,000 is not unlikelym as that would be a regular 30% to 40% correction.

Critical levels to watch for Bitcoin

The daily chart of Bitcoin shows some critical levels to watch for the current period. First of all, the recent drop-down brought Bitcoin’s price to a vital support level. It should hold this zone between $42,000 and $44,000 to avoid more downside.

If this doesn’t hold, a further drop to the level around $37,000 is likely. This would also grant a retest of the 21-week MA.

However, if the green zone between $42,000 and $44,000 does provide support, a rebound is likely toward $63,000, as previously stated.

02/22/21,"Bitcoin sold off today, dropping nearly 10% early in the day to reach my Wave 2 correction price target as shown above before finding support at a key bullish support level and recouping a majority of the losses. If this was indeed [our Wave 2 correction] then that's great, as it happened sooner than we were expecting and that should allow Bitcoin to begin consolidating before resuming to higher highs. This is eerily similar to what happened a month or so ago when Bitcoin rallied from $14K to $42K in a few weeks' time, then dropped over $10K in a day to under $29K, and promptly recovered to $34K or so. I suspect we are likely seeing something similar play out in the same accelerated fashion. 

If Bitcoin did not put in its W2 correction bottom yet, then we could see Bitcoin drift lower for some time to then put in a double-bottom or marginally lower low before resuming the uptrend again. This is entirely possible so we'll have to monitor it but for the time being, enjoy the discounted prices.

However, in many countries taxes are already applicable when cashing out your crypto-earnings today and with the steady increase in value stricter regulations are sure to come in the near future. Therefore, ignoring this topic can often proof to be perilous.

As for now, taxation throughout the EU is still up to the individual countries (even though uniform taxation will most likely be introduced sooner or later as governments finally begin to understand the true power of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology).

Generally speaking, there are a few things that are important to remember when thinking about trading crypto assets (these seem to be applicable for most countries):

* If taxed, crypto assets usually fall under capital gains tax, income tax, or VAT (upon conversion to fiat currencies).

* This means that crypto assets can attract anywhere from 0-50% tax, depending on how the asset is intended to be used as well as the individual tax bracket one falls into under consideration of earnings from work or other investments.

* These rates mostly apply as soon as you realize your earnings (therefore even when one is just selling coins on an exchange and not leaving them on the exchange/in their wallet for re-investing or in order to cash out at a later time).

* Most importantly: when trading as an individual, there is often a possibility to reduce ones Income Tax liability by offsetting losses against future profits or other income. With some countries tax liability is even cancelled entirely when investing only for the purposes of hodling (no staking!) and not selling it within the first year.

So to my fellow traders (maybe even hodlers?) I say:

Stay informed, when chasing out pay your taxes ( I know it sucks, but its smarter to do it now than to pay even more fines once the government decide to crack down on cryptos in terms of taxation) or, and I would like to stress this option, just keep HODLING!",0.044,0.878,0.078,0.8929
02/23/21,"**TLDR; SimpleSwap won’t send your coins if exchange rates change unfavorably for them, and will hold onto your coins waiting for them to improve in their favor. Otherwise they hold them hostage unless you want to accept fewer coins. Customer service will make up lies as needed.**

\*I’m posting here because they actively advertise (spam) on this sub regularly, and people have a right to know how they operate.

I recently sent several thousand USD worth of coins to SimpleSwap. They received the coins very quickly, confirmed it, then it was stuck on “exchanging” for hours. 24 hours went by, and I reached out to customer service, who eventually responded to say that it was a “one time technical issue” and that the engineers were working on resolving it. By the second day, they reached back out to say that the problem really was that the exchange rates have changed, and so the transaction had been automatically suspended as a result to *protect my funds*. SimpleSwap said they’ll only be willing to send me fewer coins but not the originally agreed amount.

I replied and said that the new rate only negatively affects them, not me, and that they should send the correct amount of coins as agreed. SimpleSwap then claimed that actually the problem is really that I chose “floating rate” instead of “fixed rate” (which is a lie, I always have chosen fixed rate). This is obviously incorrect as had I chosen floating rate, the transaction would have gone through automatically since it would have made them more money, which itself is the reason I never choose floating rate.

So basically, if rates change, SimpleSwap only send the coin if rates change in their favor, otherwise they won’t send you the agreed amount. Here it is over two days later and SimpleSwap still has my coins, and are **holding them hostage** unless I want to accept fewer coins, and they’re making up multiple lies to try and cover themselves. I asked for a refund, but as of this posting they have not done so.",0.06,0.877,0.063,-0.4143
02/23/21,"Hey Everyone,

I’m aware of the risks and I have strong interest in attempting to swing trade and trade futures. 

However, with my time in the crypto space especially in the futures community “Do your own research” is said to newer people advising them not to trade based off limited information or a Crypto investors tweet. The next piece of advice is to look into each coin/project/platform themselves and learn what they do and formulate your own opinions on whether you should invest or not based off the information you research. 

This is good advice but very broad and I don’t think people(including myself)know exactly how to effectively research and learn about investment opportunities or new exciting crypto currency’s or technologies. 

My question and objective here is to find out good places to look for crypto news, investment opportunities, or new technologies? What makes you keep an eye on a coin or better yet what are key aspects that make you invest or track the progress of a certain coin? How do you know your research is generally correct and unbiased? What are things to look for that give cryptocurrency’s and technologies the legs to stick around in the crypto space for awhile? What are the final factors that make you pull the trigger on opening a new position or putting money into a new coin or project? What types of technical analysis data and charts do you monitor? 

TL;DR: Elaborate on “Do your own research” Give new investors suggestions on how to improve their effectiveness and stay unbiased during research for new crypto investments strategies.

Today i bought 5 coins from market order almost at the same time. I was ready typed the amount and  waiting for click on different tabs. But one of my trade was not on order history. i got suspicious then looked the wallet. I calculated the price and checked the price on that time period because i entered fixed amounts for all of 5 trades almost same time . Unfortunately i bought the coin 5 percent higher than the normal price in that time period. They purposely do not show in their trade history.

So when u use Binance, If your trade is not in Trade History , there is probably a high percent of slippage. This is a huge scam. The bad thing is they don't show only that trade in order history. Other trades are visible.

02/25/21,"After the recent dip of nearly 22%, the bulls are trying to regain 100-Simple Moving Average support. 

Currently Bitcoin is trading at $49,000, well above the 23.7% Fib retracement level from last swing high at $58,250 to swing low at $45,000. There was also break above the resistance trend line. However there is a key resistance level at $51,650 yet to be cleared to trigger fresh momentum. This key resistance level is the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $58,400 swing high to $45,000 swing low. Also, the 100 hourly simple moving average is nearing at $51,650.

# Gains limited?

In case the Bitcoin price successfully closes above the resistance level ($51,650), the Bitcoin could try to push past the 53,250 and 55,000 level.

# Another dip?

If Bitcoin USD price fails to clear the $51,650 resistance level, the lost momentum could trigger selling pressure. In the downtrend, an initial support could be near $48,150. In case there is a clear break below the $48,150 level, the price could retest the $45,000 support level.

# Technical indicators:

* Based on hourly [BTC USD price change] the MACD is gaining momentum towards the bullish zone and the RSI of BTC/USD is above the 50 level.

The move will effectively sell-off a majority of the company’s Bitcoin holdings to purchase rising projects Cardano and Polkadot. According to the company, the increase in these altcoin holdings will better serve the needs of FD7 investors who are looking to diversify their portfolios in the growing cryptocurrency space.

“Aside from the fact that Bitcoin was first to market and society has given it meaning as a store of value, I think Bitcoin is actually pretty useless,” Says Prakash Chand, Managing Director at FD7 Ventures. “Projects such as Cardano, Polkadot and Ethereum are the foundation of the new internet and Web 3.0.”

Both the founder of Cardano, Charles Hoskinson, and the founder of Polkadot, Dr. Gavin Wood, are considered to be two of the brightest minds working in the crypto development space today. Both figures were part of the original seven co-founders of Ethereum. In their current roles, Hoskinson and Wood lead projects that are regarded as having the potential for significant worldwide impact. Cardano’s ADA team is working towards a blockchain solution to address the needs of millions of unbanked individuals in Africa and other countries while Polkadot continues to build out an ecosystem of “moonshot” projects that enable a fully decentralized platform for Web3 where users are in control.

“I’ve been lucky enough to spend lots time with the brightest minds in crypto and I’m willing to bet that each of Ethereum, Cardano and Polkadot will be more valuable than Bitcoin within the next few years,” continued Chand.

FD7 Ventures has already begun the process of converting their Bitcoin (BTC) to Cardano (ADA) and Polkadot (DOT) and expects to complete the conversion transactions by mid-to-end of March.",0.0,0.882,0.118,0.9884

02/27/21,"TL;DR - Dip Came early and strange market conditions, but still bullish using the current LPPL model.

Price action shows a sooner and lower dip than anticipated, but appear to be consolidating this week as expected.

The market actually appears to be heating up, as more frequent oscillations moved the critical date by which we expect a collapse to early June 2021.

While recent movements may spook those new to Bitcoin, it’s not that much different than those experienced in 2017. In fact, the local corrections have stayed below 30% on the daily price chart, which is less volatile than those experienced in 2017.

Experimenting with an “overheat-o-meter” (still a work in progress): we appear to be in a consolidation zone of $39k-$55k, and will overheat above $55k. The next consolidation zone appears to be $55k-$75k.

Bitcoin will keep you humble, and this past week did seem to be fairly unlikely according to the model. If you notice the lower dashed green line in last week’s forecast, we appear to have been consolidating around that level. This week’s forecast sees a potential for a temporary dip to as low as $39k, and then upwards pressure up.

I see some combination of last week’s and this week’s forecast as presenting two possible future trajectories. As discussed in the post, this week’s forecast anticipates the market will further heat-up, while last week’s forecast predicted general consolidation.

03/02/21,"Bitcoin had a relatively rough time last week as it plunged by more than 30% after reaching a new all-time high of $58,000. The main factor of that “massive” drop was most likely the action in the US Treasuries market.

Because of the market general view that US economic recovery will speed up, which will then force the Fed to think about increasing the interest rates earlier than expected. The 10-year Treasury yields rose to 1.60%, the highest level in past one year. Furthermore, the $1.9 trillion stimulus package also suppressed the bitcoin price.

Since bitcoin and US Treasury are considered as hedging assets, one becomes more attractive will discourage that of the other.

However, BTC/USD has recovered in the past two days as the yields appear to be softening, and strong institutional support. From the fundamental aspects, Bitcoin seems to be more bullish in March.

The total number of Bitcoins on the exchanges is falling again, having gradually decreased since the beginning of 2021, according to data from Glassnode.

Knowing how much Bitcoin is held on the exchanges can tell us a lot  about the current state of the market, as well as giving us insight into  what Bitcoin investors are thinking. If Bitcoin is drifting out of  exchanges in mass, it tends to mean that investors are saving their  assets for the long term, rather than looking to trade for short-term  gains.



&gt;“The data clearly shows an asset that is in high demand  and appears to have investor confidence, which further implies that the  resale of the newly acquired Bitcoin is not being considered in the  short term,” Jason Deane, Bitcoin analyst at Quantum Economics, he told  Decrypt.



Between February 23 and March 2, there was a 2% drop in Bitcoin held  on the exchanges. This corresponds to 52,900 Bitcoins (US $ 2.7 billion)  being removed from the exchanges. This continues a downward trend of  one year, as more Bitcoins continue to be drained from the exchanges for  long-term storage.

03/06/21,"TL;DR -

- Currently in a holding pattern due to macro economy, but upwards pressure is building. No quantitative predictions in the bullet points this week.

- If there is an ATH by April, we can expect a euphoric rise in the April-May timeframe, otherwise we may enter a more laid back market until the Fall.

- The next few weeks are critical for the macro picture. Bitcoin still looks poised for takeoff, but hedging might be a good idea if Fed rates increase.

Macro factors seem to be pushing Bitcoin to have either a euphoric rise in April-May or later in the Fall. As discussed last week, there seem to be two outcomes the current bull market is flipping between, and macro factors could influence which scenario actually plays out:

1. Short-term Overheating: Recently, the model suggests the price action is consistent with overheating. We’re in a temporary consolidation zone, and then the price will skyrocket April-May with extreme euphoria. This points to a top between $100k-$200k (actual number is anyone’s guess) before the end of June.

2. Short-term Consolidation to repeat Fall 2017: If we consolidate for the next weeks to months, the market will cool down enough and we could coil up for a run in the Fall, similar to what happened in 2017. In this case, we can expect a slower rise through $100k over the summer and then a wild dash past $200k+. Under this scenario, I think talk of the “super-cycle” could drive the price to wild heights I dare not predict. But Bitcoin is here to surprise us.

Both scenarios are at the mercy of the greater economy, and this brings us to the even more speculative discussion in the rest of the post.

While Bitcoin was built to fight inflation, the chaos inflation can cause in the markets will not necessarily be good for Bitcoin in the short term.

Long term, Bitcoin adoption should increase and its value along with it, but for the current storm formation, this is a space to watch.

03/13/21,"TL;DR - The market is heating up, and the possibility of a cycle top by the end of June. Keep in mind more information could change this, but this week we make our first “cycle end” forecast.

- We could see another local dip if the price rises above $70k in the next week. Last time the model predicted a local dip, the dip came early, so might be worth keeping that in mind.

- End of March-Early April we could enter another consolidation zone, probably above $55k. Previous dips have stayed above the local ATH of the previous dip, so that implies we stay above $58k for the next local dip.

- Moon math indicates we enter market euphoria mid-April when the price flirts with $100k. If this plays out, we could see $200k by mid-May and a cycle end before the end of June. Dare I say $500k is in play if interpreting the model after consuming too much hopium (although this is unlikely).

- With more speculative lenses on, a 80% correction implies a bear market bottom in the next few years of $40k-100k.

The price action this past week has been exciting! It has returned to its all time high (ATH), and broken it, although at the time of writing it’s not clear if it will breeze through or if $60k will have some resistance as profit taking occurs at that level. Last time we recovered to the ATH from a dip, there was a small correction before moving upwards again.

For the upcoming week, once the price decisively claims the ATH, we should see a short term rise until another correction. This could happen in the next week, but almost certainly will happen in the next two weeks. That said, we may be entering a more frenetic phase in the bull cycle and dips will occur over shorter timeframes.

Above $70k is a price to look at for when a local dip seems likely. In theory, we could reach $100k as soon as the next few weeks as its right at the upper 95% confidence band, although this would also mean a more intense local correction.

I'm not an expert on reading the blockchain or how accurate this bitinfocharts website is, but this wallet appears to be gaining like 600 BTC every day and then dumping them on an exchange every so often and potentially causing these crashes. They transferred ~33k bitcoins seemingly to an exchange on Feb 21st literally right at the $58k peak and then yesterday they transferred out ~18k BTC which immediately preceded this current crash.

I'm not sure this amount of BTC can even move the markets this severely, considering Cryptoqaunt's data show F2Pool-associated addresses selling off similarly huge amounts every day since the beginning of January. Perhaps it's just a coincidence that these 2 transfers coincided with the crashes, or maybe their huge transfers just sparked some fear.

03/20/21,"TL;DR - We’ve begun our rise up after our last dip, as predicted last week we had a mini-correction after hitting the ATH but are looking at setting a new ATH in earnest in the coming weeks

- We’ve experienced the slight pullback predicted after hitting the ATH, will we establish a new ATH in earnest soon?

- Once we claim the new ATH, a larger local correction (~30%) looks likely, but not in the immediate future. That said, $50k is the low value that the model believes we will stay above for 95% of the simulated trajectories.

- We discuss the “overly-optimistic” nature of the current model. Once price becomes parabolic on the log chart, predictions should be more reliable. I’ll be exploring some new models in the meantime.

- The two scenarios: 1) short term overheating, or 2) more of a cool down for a later rise are both still in play. The current model seems to be unable to decide between the two. Exogenous macro factors are important to gain the full picture.

This past week we had quite a bit of consolidation around the ATH level of $58k-60k. By all indications, we should continue to rise steadily in the next week. The newly fitted model from the latest price action shows this past week has been a very healthy thing, the longer-term exponential build has cooled off slightly.

The lowest end of the prediction is around $50k for the next few days, while the average price is predicted to steadily rise. To add my personal interpretation, I believe this fit may indicate we have not yet resolved which of the two scenarios discussed in previous weeks will actually play out. This may be due to exogenous factors, such as the macro environment, as we will have to see if more capital flows into Bitcoin under the threat of increased inflation.

I’m going to continue tracking the LPPL model fit, but I’m starting to think about how to quantify whether the data supports “super-exponential” growth yet. This would look like parabolic growth on a log chart. In the past few months, the price has looked more like a line on a log chart, thus we are in “exponential” rather than “super-exponential” growth. More discussion on this in the post.

###A relentless bull
This bull market has been relentless. Our pacing is at around 1% a day, compounding. We've been holding that since november. In the last bull that flopped around a lot more. Sometimes it would drop to 0.5%, or go all the way up to 2% for short periods. In contrast, what we are experiencing in this bull market is substantially more stable.

I've been reflecting on how hard it would have been to hold my current position if we were to see that kind of volatility again. I think I could do it, but my mood would be disproportionately altered.

Remember to take care of yourself, first.

### Past is prologue
On January 2nd, this year, I published a projection on trading view that several other people have taken notice of in the last month or two. It's not hard to see, it's just the current price vs  past halvings and their corresponding bull markets.



It looks like we might, eventually, in the next month or two, outperform all past halvings. If your baseline is past bull markets, we're a long way from doing better than 2012 - 2013, but we're not out of reach.

If we're contemplating the likelihood that this market is anything like past halvings, we really need to check ourselves. Volatility is so low that it's becoming harder and harder to dislodge Bitcoin from long-term holders, as well as new market participants.

###Murder your preconceptions
When we violate the projection of all past halvings, I think we're looking at a significantly higher baseline for the final push up and the blow-off top. I think that's why PlanB's s2fx model has a reasonable, and what may eventually be conservative, baseline of 288k for the recovery after the blow-off top.

Here's what moving to that baseline by early july looks like:



###One Million USD per bitcoin is still on the table

1 mil this year is not off the table. There has been a path forward. There is still a path forward. The path we're on doesn't look like the past. The path we're on looks like something much more steady and sustained.

If I posted the charts were seeing today in November, there would only have been scorn and ridicule. It seemed impossible. It was not; not in the slightest.

TLDR: If you are bullish on BTC, long BTC-MOVE-2021Q2 is actually better than long June futures

I will explain below.



Ticker:

BTC-MOVE-2021Q2



Exchange:

FTX

(Note that FTX has US website, however this futures product is only available on the international FTX website which is not available for US residents)



Description:

BTC-MOVE-2021Q2 settles to the absolute value of the change in the price of BTC between 3/26/2021 and 6/25/2021.



Trade Ideas:

BTC-MOVE-2021Q2 strike price is 52k

Currently it costs 17k (33% of strike price)



Let's assume BTC doubles its price in Q2 from 52k to 104k

(assume 1x leverage with fiat collateral, long trade, no liquidation price)



&gt;If you long BTC June futures at 52k

Settlement price: 104k

Your profit: 104k / 52k = **2x (100% PNL)**



&gt;If you long 2021 Q2 MOVE at 17k with the same capital as above

Settlement price: 104k - 52k = 52k

Your profit 52k / 17k = **3.05x (205% PNL)**



(you profit more with the same capital)



But wait, what if Q2 is the start of bear market and we end up at 20k on Jun 25?



&gt;If you long June futures at 52k

Loss, definitely.



&gt;If you long 2021 Q2 MOVE at 17k

You actually still profit because MOVE settlement price is the absolute difference of BTC price between 03/26 and 06/25

Settlement price: abs(20k - 52k) = 32k

Your profit 32k / 17k = **1.88x (88% PNL)**



The catch?

long 2021 Q2 MOVE at 17k will lose if BTC price at the end of June is between 35k - 69k (the absolute difference is less than your long entry)

but of course you can close before expiration (after a +/-30% move, you should be able to close in profit)



Final notes:

Since currently BTC price is still very near Q2 MOVE strike price, it's highly likely that you can get better price than 17k during low volatility period like this weekend.

\-40.59% (Open to Highest/Lowest Wick)

\-38.21% (Open to Highest/Lowest Wick)



2018 Q4

\-41.32% (Open to Close)

\-52.91% (Open to Highest/Lowest Wick)





As you can see from above, 35% of strike price or lower should be a good entry for quarterly MOVE long.

03/27/21,"TL;DR - Another week of sideways action. Possibly due to end of quarter rebalancing and options expiration. March is a bad month historically, will April revalidate the LPPL model, or is a new model needed?

- Price did not go below $50k this week, which was the forecasted lower limit (95% confidence). We could see lower this coming week, however, ~$45k is now the lower limit.

- The LPPL model has been very optimistic and is still bullish for April. Time will tell to determine if the price will return to that predicted by LPPL, or if a new model is needed.

- The long-term forecast still looks strong, sometimes it’s important to zoom out and gain perspective.

- First Formula 1 GP of 2021 is this weekend, how is Bitcoin related? (Hint: sponsors and math!)

While perhaps seemingly orthogonal to Bitcoin price, the technology in Formula 1 presents an interesting analogy to many of the concepts for understanding the shorter-term price volatility in Bitcoin. Any racing driver knows that suspension and grip are among the two most important technical considerations when driving around a track.

Suspension can be modeled by spring-mass systems, which also happen to be one of the simplest dynamical systems one can study and can be used to model oscillations in asset prices like Bitcoin.

Conversely, grip is a familiar non-linear effect, tires work well up until a critical point, upon which static friction gives way to kinetic friction and the car goes sliding off the track. In Bitcoin, we can think of cascading liquidations of leveraged positions as losing grip on the racetrack. It is a nonlinear effect, as you don't see it until a point, and then the effect is undeniably catastrophic (in the short term).

Is he making any sense? Most of these claims seem easily refuted. 

Bitcoin – you’ve all heard enough about Bitcoin so no explanation is needed. Of the group above, I believe it has, relatively, the best story and outlook. The key in that statement is the word “relatively”. Bitcoin has a lot of risks and uncertainties attached to it. Here are a few…it is being touted as a replacement for our currency but how can one accept Bitcoin in payment for goods and services if its value is inherently unstable? Also, because its ownership and exchange are not transparent and as easily traceable, how long will governments allow it to be a medium of exchange when money laundering and the evasion of taxes is being facilitated? Likely, not very long. Once regulation of Bitcoin comes to pass, will it continue to exist…and if it does continue to exist, what would its value be then? By the way, can anyone tell me how I can calculate within some reasonable parameters of probability what a Bitcoin should be worth? I can’t figure it out. Again, it’s likely not a silver bullet either. As an aside, I have no idea how the board of directors at Tesla have allowed its CEO to put $1.5 billion dollars of the company’s cash into Bitcoin. That is money that belongs to shareholders, and if Elon’s bet doesn’t work out, it could spell big trouble for Tesla shareholders (not to mention I believe that based on their current and reasonably foreseeable profits, the shares are already grossly overpriced even without the Bitcoin issue). Finally, a recent study at the University of Cambridge determined that mining for Bitcoin uses more electricity than the entire country of Argentina uses in a year. And, “Nature” a prestigious British academic journal has recently declared that Bitcoin mining could be responsible for pushing global warming up by 2°C.

I just want to know if they can legally do this or if the coins now belong to me. Any advice is welcome on this issue.

This is important for all of us. I can't seem to find concise or simplified information on this.

What are the top indicators (technical and fundamental) we should be looking at to know when the BTC bull market is close to over. And what do you look for when analyzing them.

Could you give a simple and short explanation on each. If we all share that information here, we can all learn from one another. This is super important. 

Also, what are some good places you know, social media accounts, YT channels  or tools that give this kind of information that we should pay attention to.

04/02/21,"Customers of the U.S. payment system got the opportunity to use digital money to pay for goods and services. Experts explained why this is important and can influence similar decisions in Apple Pay and Google Pay.

PayPal has allowed U.S. customers to use cryptocurrency. Users who hold Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin in their wallets will be able to convert them into fiat currencies at the time of purchase at 29 million merchants that work with the payment system.

Against this backdrop, the bitcoin exchange rate rose sharply, peaking at $59,300 for the first time since March 20. Quotes for the cryptocurrency came close to the all-time high of $61,800 set on March 14.

PayPal’s announcement is another milestone in the global acceptance of cryptocurrency as a means of payment and a reinforcement of its fundamental importance, explained Vladimir Smetanin, CEO of Newcent, Swiss financial firm.

The event follows a string of other announcements — Tesla’s recent announcement, Visa’s news yesterday — but it is different in that it covers a huge number of outlets (29 million, according to PayPal) and therefore potentially customers worldwide — with the appropriate country legislation and access to full functionality.

Last week, Tesla added the ability to pay for its products with bitcoins. For now, the service is only available to U.S. customers; it will appear in other countries later this year. The company will not convert BTC received as payment into fiat currency.

At the same time, Visa became the first of the major payment systems which began to carry out transactions in cryptocurrency. The company transferred USDC Stablecoin using the Ethereum blockchain. Previously, it allowed its users to make transactions only in fiat currency.

PayPal, Visa, Tesla are American companies, and this is important because the cryptocurrency industry depends on certain decisions of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Amid this news, bitcoin may soon update its historical high in value.

This kind of green light from PayPal and other payment systems could influence similar decisions in Apple Pay and Google Pay. Especially since Apple Pay executives have spoken quite positively about cryptocurrencies and have even done integration with BitPay.

Back in the fall of 2019, Apple Pay vice president Jennifer Bailey said the payments company was interested in the digital space. She said that cryptocurrencies have long-term potential and great prospects for the future. At the same time, in February of this year, cryptoprocessing service BitPay announced that it would add its card to Apple Pay.",0.03,0.875,0.096,0.9861

04/03/21,"TL;DR - Yet another week of sideways action. Short update this week because not much has changed structurally. Bullish hopes lie with April, the month of rebirth and rain.

- Stable prices this week, resistance keeping prices below $60k.

- Growing overextended leveraged positions could mean we have a brief swing lower, but all indications show that the market is anticipating a breakout.

- The LPPL model is making a similar “rising price trend” prediction this week, but $50k is the statistical floor (~95% confidence). This has increased from about $45k predicted last week.

- The mean price predicts a test of $100k by the end of April. We have recently been undershooting this level, but if euphoria takes hold this month, this is a statistically realistic possibility.

“How about this week?”

While the model is refit every week, we can look at the current fit to try and understand how the model is currently “thinking about” the previous $60k tests. According to the model fit, the first test was an overextension of the previous rally that broke the previous $50k (or €40k ) resistance, and the price then checked the lower confidence bound. The second test confirmed the average price as the model predicted sideways consolidation. This third test occurs below the expected price, right as the model expects a new rally through the month of April. Using this “statistical hindsight,” this test looks to have a better setup for a price rally than the previous two. Time will tell, but as we’ve come to expect, the LPPL model is bullish.

04/05/21,"So I am testing some models and they are very sensitive to fees. 

And I'm testing them on bitmex vs binance but some things I just don't understand. 

My model in terms of trading does simple things. If it's a buy signal, it places limit buy order at the lowest ask price, and if it's a shorting signal, it places limit sell order at the highest bid price (at least for the perpetual contracts on Bitmex, it seems that shorting can be done just by ""selling"" at the highest bid price given that there are no long positions on that crypto.)

BITMEX : 

so the market taker is charged 0.075%. But what about market makers? they seem to provide you 0.025% in BTC to your account for providing liquidity. since I'm placing the limit buy order at the highest bid price, i wouldn't be ""providing liquidity"" per se so that wouldn't apply to me? 

Also, what about shorting? so for long positions, I would be charged 0.075% upon closing that position, but if that was a short position, what would I be charged? the same?



BINANCE:

so it seems that there are different Tiers. VIP\_0 for example, charges the market taker 0.1% so if I were to go long or short, I will be charged 0.1%? while the market makers would be given 0.1%? that seems odd considering how the bid-ask spread on Binance is much wider than that of Bitmex. 

But aside from that, there is this ""BNB 25% off"" and ""BNB x Referral 25% off x Kickback 20%"" which has 0.075% and 0.06% fee respectively. 

I figure ""BNB 25% off"" refers to the minimum amount of BNB &gt;= 0 I would need to have in my balance? 

But what about Referral and Kickback? I figure Referral is just using the referral code when signing up I guess, but what's ""Kickback""?",0.07,0.92,0.01,-0.9474

Have been hearing a lot about ""risk-free"" bitcoin trading strategies recently:

*Currently, the spot price (market price for bitcoin on exchanges) trades lower than futures prices. The spread for the June futures contract is more than 25 percent annualized on most major exchanges.*

*This means that anyone can buy bitcoin and use that bitcoin as collateral to sell the June futures contract. This trade locks in a risk-free 6 percent USD-denominated return (more than 25 percent annualized) no matter where the price of bitcoin goes over the following months.*

*The only risk is exchange custody (losing coins due to poor management or hacks).*

04/21/21,"Hello everyone,

I am testing some BTC trezor suite and I saw that there is a ""trade"" button which could be useful if I would like to trade my btc to a stablecoin in order to buy again in a lower price.

I saw a strategy which suggested selling 1% per day on June, 2% on July and so on.

Even though I understand this, I have some technical issues:



* If I understand correctly, due to periodical small btc buys the transaction bytes on my wallet are a lot, and so are the fees. Should I send all my crypto to my wallet again to resolve this? Is it a valid solution and if not which is?
* Should I move my crypto outside from the wallet to convert them, in a platform like coinbase pro?
* Is it a valid strategy to convert like 1% per week of btc to stablecoin in order to re-enter or due to high fees its useless?
* Or I should just wait for the crash and the next crypto market? Which is a valid option for me because I don't hold my btc so I wont be a big hit on me.

04/22/21,"Hi, here are some thoughts.

Regarding overall ATH and the PI cycle, I would say it is bullshit. You should not trust it. It has three numerical parameters (350, 100, and 2) and it could fit 3 points. It is clear that in most cases you can fit 3 points with 3 parameters. In fact, you give me any other 3 points and I can most probably construct an indicator with 3 parameters that matches it.   
Thing is though, that these parameters are somewhat realistic, so it is not out of the blue to consider something similar. The stress is on \*something similar\*. Many other indicators could work and produce the same ,,prediction''.

The fact that now we have a local top seems to follow from a coincidence of multiple reasons. 

1. We had slowing down momentum anyways.

2. Too much hype around COINBASE listing, and the usual disappointment afterwards.

3. The chinese blackout.

All of these reasons contributed. 

My suggestions and ideas:  
Stay calm, more is to come. I think that Technical Analysis is very often just hocus pocus. However, some ingredients could be trusted. Going below certain moving averages IS a big psychological red sign for many traders. Inflow is not abundant now, and then people will just go short. Going below the 50day MA, touching the 1T market cap, approaching 50K, these are bad signs for medium term price action. I think we should not expect a quick recovery now. This will go down more.

I can not predict whether we will bounce back from 50K or go below. But I think that we will not stop around 53K and the 50K will be tested. I think we can not know more at the present time.

I understand that many many global indicators show the bull cycle is intact. I also think that this is not yet over. We can not call the end of the bull cycle, after just 5 days of crazy action. We would need much much more than that. 

If anything, new investors will be encouraged by a drop of 20-30%, if we establish a bottom there.   


In the medium term we should also look out for developments in the stock market. The S&amp;P 500 seems overvalued and stressed. A correction of 10% is likely within a couple of weeks. That could drag BTC down a bit more. So I am bearish for the short and medium term PA (meaning 2-3 weeks, maybe even 2 months).

\---

I was wondering how this cycle could be different from other cycles. It is clear that there will be a difference. Going to different orders of magnitudes, you can not expect that the same thing will happen. For example, the next cycle will certainly not see that same PA as this cycle. Right now we are around the magnitude of the market cap of silver. So even if we go towards GOLD, there are no new magnitudes to explore. You can not expect to go to ten times the value of Gold. It is complete nonsense. So even if we reach some BTC price of 100K or even 500K or similar, the path towards it can  be really different from other cycles. Simply the available room above our heads is limited. You will not grow exponentially when there is a realistic ceiling above your head.

I understand that the market cap is not a good measure. I think the realized market cap is a good measure. Right now it still shows inflow of money, which is good. The first real bearish sign would be if we see even a slight decline in this measure within 2-3 weeks. That would be a serious problem. A slowing down does not mean much. So I really suggest to look for this quantity.

An other thing to consider is that we might not have a blow off top this time. Now that the whole world is watching, BTC is on the brink of becoming mainstream, the dynamics could be fundamentally different. Expecting a parabolic rise and a blow off top is a good theory, but I would not count on it.

The other thing is that now so many people are expecting a crypto winter, and a subsequent rise, that I think the winter will be less harsh, and the rise afterwards also less intense. The more people expect something, the less likely it will go as expected. I suspect that BTC will stay with us, I suspect that a winter and one more cycle will come, but less dramatic.

The only thing which could make things go to extremes is a wide ban on crypto. I think we are not going in this direction, but this could change in the future. Thinking about the years ahead, international tensions, unexpected developments can have an effect on the ideas of governments about crypto. If hard bans start to emerge, then the winter will be cold again. We need mainstream adoption for these prices to be sustainable.",0.079,0.876,0.045,-0.9854

04/23/21,"The big story yesterday was the proposed change in capital gains tax in the United States.  This narrative suggests that there may be a window for those with big gains on paper to sell their shares for the legacy tax rate for the remainder of this tax year.  There's also a chance that the tax level would be retroactively applied, although this would appear less likely and also less interesting.

Let's assume the capital gains tax does increase starting in 2022.  What happens in that situation?  Well, anyone who is holding a very large capital gain (only affects marginal rate beyond first 1M gain per year) will now be incentivized to crystalize their gain and pay the lower tax rate in 2021.

**American Cryptocurrency Ownership**

Yes, there are likely many American citizens with sizeable crypto gains who will be motivated to sell their crypto and lock in the lower tax rate.  That puts an initial downward pressure.  Most of the $1.8T in global crypto market was created in 2021, so we're talking about potentially $1-1.5T+ in unrealized gains across the industry.

Let's also remember, with Bitcoin especially, a certain amount of coins are completely dormant / inaccessible.

[

This article estimated between 2.78M - 3.79M BTC are completely inaccessible.  This would represent 15-20% of the total supply, or $138-$185 Billion worth of market cap on Bitcoin alone.  This brings the total global market cap closer to $1.6T as of this writing.  And it doesn't account for lost coins on any other projects.  The effective unrealized gains of the crypto industry is likely closer to $1T.

How much of that is in the hands of American citizens with millions in unrealized gains?  I'm sure it's a reasonable amount, but very hard to say.  If we look at crypto exchange volumes, Binance (non-US) has $61B in 24h volume, Coinbase has $7.5B.  As a percentage of the industry, I think it's fair to estimate that somewhere between 10-15% of crypto assets are held by American citizens.  This would represent taxable gains of $100-150B for US citizens.

**American Equity Ownership**

But what about the Americans who have no cryptocurrency?  A lot of institutions, big investors, will face a similar situation with equities.  The US equities markets are massive.  We're talking nearly $50T market cap.  And unlike the crypto markets, the US owns a lot of US equities.  A LOT.

[

This article estimates that Americans owned about 60% of US equities in 2019.  About 25% of US equities were in US taxable accounts.  Americans also own plenty of other assets, including foreign equities, real estate, precious metals, etc.  All told, we're probably talking about $10T+, possibly even $20T+ in capital gains that could be subject to this rate increase.

What does this mean?  Well, potentially, it means that $10-20T in capital gains could be sold to lock in the legacy capital gains rate.  The underlying value of these assets could be $30-40T.  Of this amount, maybe $100-150B is cryptocurrency.

**The Real Takeaways are:**

* Cryptocurrency ownership is highly globalized, and significantly non-US
* US equity ownership is owned at much higher levels by US citizens vs. cryptocurrency
* Nearly every asset is in a bull market (real estate, equity, crypto, etc.)

**What are the Implications?**

Taking all the above information into consideration, we would expect to see trillions in asset sales from US citizens to avoid the new capital gains rate.  We would expect the overwhelming majority of assets sold to be non-crypto.  When including precious metals and real estate, we can assume crypto assets represent well below 1% in unrealized capital gains in US taxable accounts.

**The Great Rebalancing?**

~~When selling an asset to lock in capital gains, one stipulation is that you cannot repurchase the same asset within 30 days.~~  This means we'd have trillions of dollars floating around *potentially* looking to rebalance or reposition.  It would be conceivable that this new influx of capital could find its way into the cryptocurrency markets.

This may be a unique moment where large-scale investors re-examine their portfolio allocations and make big changes.  After all, they have a ton of capital to deploy.  It would appear to be very conceivable that these asset managers would be open to allocating capital to crypto which had been tied up in traditional assets.

This capital gains tax has the potential to redefine portfolio management and asset allocation.  It's easy to ignore cryptocurrency when your money is sitting in Google stock that has 10X'ed.  It's harder to do so when you are forced to sell said stock and now have to allocate that capital somewhere else.

*TL;DR - This capital gains tax could result in trillions of dollars being rebalanced and could potentially redefine portfolio management for the modern ages.  This could be the first time in history where professional large-scale asset managers seriously consider cryptocurrency as a viable and investable asset class.*

EDIT: I appear to be mistaken on the wash-trading rule in the United States.  Most replies have pointed out that there is no restriction when ""locking in a gain"", this only applies when ""locking in a loss"".  Further, there is no equivalent rule for cryptocurrency in either direction (according to replies).  As a note, please consult a professional tax lawyer or accountant for reliable tax advice.  I am neither of those things.  Also note that none of the above is financial advice.  Do your own research.",0.037,0.811,0.153,0.9985

04/25/21,"Hi

I’ve just released the first draft of a streaming cryptocurrency data website you may be interested in. It collects normalized data from multiple exchanges and produces central, fee-adjusted orderbooks and arbitrage tables for each currency along with analysis (e.g. option pricing, trade size distributions/skews/kurtosis, arbitrage alerts, breakout alerts etc.)

You can see the:

Home page: 

Docs: 

Pro Version: 

And as an example, you can look at the:

BTCUSD perpetual central orderbook: 

Huobi BCHUSD asset: 

BTCUSD spot arbitrage table: 

The rest are available as links from the home page.

The idea is that the web platform will provide all the data and analytics for free in as useful a format as possible, such as combined orderbooks, depth graphs, etc. whilst there will be a subscription-based Pro version which allows WebSocket subscription to subsidize the free version.

The web platform uses the entry-tier marginal Taker fees to adjust the central orderbook prices, but the WebSocket version allows for a parameter to be set to adjust the fee level on each exchange - for example, if you have a VIP or market-maker tier fee arrangement.

It is a very early draft (as you can tell!) but the goal is to add more of the features that I have been developing, ranging from commodified indicators (SMAs, Vanna Volga Pricing, Heston Pricing etc.) through to potentially new or interesting indicators, like some measures of jump diffusion, breakout detection, order execution / implementation shortfall estimates, and fragmentation measures. Some of these are listed in the documentation along with examples.

You can just plug the WebSocket into your existing codebase and then not have to worry about collecting the data or using your compute resource to calculate essential but commodified indicators. There is also always the chance that some of the additional indicators can incrementally improve a strategy or allow an AI model to distinguish slightly better between states. It effectively means you can spend more time on trading strategies and less on monitoring, editing and updating the core data sourcing and analytics.

Anyway, I would be very interested in your thoughts, suggestions, and ideas for anything you might find useful, and I will try to accommodate. As I say, it’s a very early draft so if you find any bugs – and I am sure there are many – it would be really helpful if you could let me know.

With the help of some talented Redditors and GitHub contributors, the algorithm is now more powerful than before, allowing you to further configure how you would like it to trade.

Many of the improvements made, were actually suggested by you in the previous post, so thanks to you all, there is now a better news algo that we can all use!

The algorithm analyses the news sentiment from biggest crypto news sites, and automatically decides what coins to buy or sell based on how many times a coin is mentioned across all headlines, and how positively or negatively it's depicted in the news headlines.

I've been working on this project for about a month now, and I can say that the bot is now in a state where it can be used and it's stable! I haven't yet tested it on the mainnet but I will put together some reports on its performance on the testnet and will post on here.

Here is the link to the open-sourced project:

And here is a step-by-step guide if you would like to set the bot up yourself but you need some more guidance on how to do so:

Chart 2: [

Bitcoin has painted a MASSIVE bullish candle on daily... over 10% pump in a day... that is over $5k pump! Impressive. We have not had such a candle since February!

Is the correction then over? Not so fast. There are two scenarios possible and you can also check my latest video on YouTube that covers the same topic (see my profile)

**Scenario 1:** BTC correction is over and we pump higher to make a new All Time High ( ATH ). For that to happen we need to crush one important resistance at $58k. If we get rejected there and pushed back down, then scenario 2 is activated.

**Scenario 2:** BTC is rejected at $58k and we will do a new low in a nice ABC pattern. This can be anywhere between $45k and $41k. We have strong support at $41k and I would be surprised for us to drop that far since buyers, especially institutional investors, will not hesitate to buy BTC at a +30% discount.

Which way we go? If we are to look at the indicators and this massive bull candle, one would lean towards scenario 1. Today was a very strong push. Questions is if we can maintain it. Likely we will find out before the end of the week.

Also this pump was predicted by the RSI + MACD bullish divergence on 4h (higher low on RSI while price did a lower low). Therefore this pump or relief was expected, apart from that nasty wick yesterday that trapped many bulls or bears? :P

(April 28, 2021  8:30PM EST)

## Short-Term: 

We are back above the 50 Day EMA now ([see chart] so the real test will be to see if BTC finds support at the 50 Day EMA or falls back below it. Staying above the 50 Day EMA is obviously bullish and we should then look to $55K and $60K. If BTC breaks below the 50 Day EMA, then we could be entering a more prolonged consolidation period in which Bitcoin oscillates in the $40K - $50K range for a while. 

The overall trend is still up so there's no cause for concern, and dips are still buying opportunities, as anyone who bought BTC last week under $50K is now up \~10%. The uptrend is not in question unless Bitcoin breaks below $40K or ultimately the 200 Day EMA around $35K, which should be our absolute floor at this point. As long as we stay above these levels, we're in bullish territory.

It's easy to let bearish sentiment distract from your vision if you don't have a sound technical strategy. 20-30% drops are significant and not uncommon in crypto, so it's especially important to zoom out and look at the charts to keep the bigger picture in the front of your mind. 

RSI has stabilized a bit after falling, currently at 47 on the daily chart. 

## Long-Term: 

[Here] is the Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D) weekly chart, showing Bitcoin's plummet in dominance to levels not seen since mid-2018. This is no concern because as the crypto space grows, so too do other projects with legitimate use-cases which take some market share.📷

With BTC.D now at a major support level, we should see buyers start to step in and a bottoming pattern start to form before Bitcoin's next macro wave up to probably around 70 - 72% BTC Dominance. This will likely be the longer-term wave that takes BTC to $100K or above before a subsequent alt rally soon to follow thereafter.

This is not reliable at all, people get easily scammed and I’m really tired that those scammers keep trying, this situation must come to an end.

In my personal case, I myself am really interested a lot in the world of cryptocurrencies and that’s why it bothers me so much that these things keep happening, that’s why I informed myself a lot more enterprises that operate with blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies. I also searched for safe forms to buy them, for example buying them from the enterprise that offers them or using softwares of enterprises that are recognized in this sector to buy and sell cryptocurrencies such as Coinbase, Uniswap, Binance, etc.

In the end, I ended up building a portfolio with cryptocurrencies such as $INXT, $DOGE and $XRP, all this without falling into this type of scams, otherwise, I would have ended up losing my money either on a bad investment or because they just take it and leave.

I hope this information is useful for other people. Please be very careful with these cyberscams. If you really want to invest in something, at least try to inform yourselves well and see how to achieve that without taking such risks, it can end up very bad.

One of the reasons for this is that the LPPL model to track “bubble-like” price action is not modeling the current price well. This indicates that the Bitcoin price is no longer fueled by speculation on bubble-like price increases.

There is still a possibility we are in a months-long consolidation period in an overall LPPL pattern, but as of now, it doesn’t make as much sense to put stock into the LPPL model until another exponential move upwards in price occurs.

So where does that leave the “Bitcoin Storm Tracker”? At the moment, these monthly updates will be more of a “Weather Report” than “Storm Tracker” as we will wait until price direction becomes more clear. While I thought it would be interesting to update the LPPL model fits each month, it’s clear that the fits are not reliable, and publishing them might wrongly imply there is reason to believe an imminent price increase.

All of that said, since the price has stabilized between $50k-$60k for the last few months, this shows tremendous strength in the current price level. In some ways, we may have found ourselves in the “eye of the storm”. Just as the overall formation of a hurricane, typhoon, or cyclone has a calm area at the center, perhaps that’s where we find ourselves in the current price action?

**The influence of institutions**

Something I’ve been thinking about recently is the influence of more institutional players applying their own price models to make trading decisions. A parallel development is the greater influence of derivatives, which did not have anywhere near the current volume during the last bull-run in 2017.

Institution participation can have a stabilizing influence on the price. For example, let’s suppose your are an institution that believes in the pattern that has formed through the last few bull-cycles: the bottom of the next cycle is a about 3x the ATH of the previous cycle. In you have a long-term view, it may make sense to sell above $60k and buy below $50k. If enough large market participants believe this, it could stabilize the fair price at $60k, effectively front-running the exponential rise in price. The resulting decrease in volatility is characteristic of larger markets, and would not be surprising to see in Bitcoin as well.

That said, this particular pattern is only one of possible models market participants may be using.

**On-Chain Metrics**

As numerous on-chain analysts have been pointed out, coins continue to move from exchange balances to external wallets, and many of the wallets coins have been moving to are known to be strong hodlers. Interestingly, after a series of apparent sell-offs, miners appear to be holding. On-chain analysis shows that many are accumulating Bitcoin and hodling for the foreseeable future. So what isn’t the price going up?

I am not an expert on on-chain analysis, but I recommend the twitter feeds from glassnode, Willy Woo and William Clemente III.

**PlanB’s Stock-to-Flow Price Model**

In the price model world, the stock-to-flow model has become the most precient. The idea is that the price is a power-law function of the stock-to-flow of Bitcoin. This means that PlanB fit a line to the log(stock-to-flow) on the x-axis and log(price) on the y-axis. The slope and y-intercept of this line are fit to the available data.

It’s important to note that this model is fit to historical data, such that the conversion from the stock-to-flow value and the price is a regression model. It assumes a power-law relationship between price and stock-to-flow. Furthermore, a moving average of the stock-to-flow price is used to model the transition from each price level. In 2017 this moving average explained the move from the two price levels in the first half of 2017, but then the price overshot the valuation. Since this moving average was selected after 2017, it remains to be seen if it holds for this cycle as well. So far it has been amazingly accurate, and may be self-fulfilling if market participants believe the model.

Jurien Timmer at Fidelity has expressed their views of the price model while considering demand alongside supply. Recently, PlanB has even stated that since supply is known to the market, the fitted model is actually predicting demand. In the long term, it would make more sense for this demand to level out as in Jurien Timmer’s version. My personal view is that modeling adoption as a S-curve is critical to estimate the long-term price floor.

Overall, it will be interesting to see how this model stands up during this bull-cycle. Perhaps more interesting, however, is if this model becomes self-fulfilling as more institutions use it to gauge the current value of Bitcoin.

Of course, one big problem is if institutions believed in this model, shouldn’t everyone front run it? Would the current price make any sense given the Efficient Market Hypothesis? PlanB as written about this. PlanB’s response is essentially: everyone may be overestimating risk, as risk adjustments keep people from believing entirely in these price appreciation models. In other words: Bitcoin price appreciation seems likely, assuming Bitcoin is not banned or a flaw in the code is not found.

When it comes to investors, this is the thing keeping the price from being front-run, despite the apparent success of these models. The multi-trillion dollar question is if the assessments of risk are correct. Due to the Lindy effect, the longer Bitcoin survives FUD and other attacks on its value proposition, the less likely we are to overestimate risk. How long must Bitcoin prove itself for different types of institutions?

I believe the Lindy effect provides a constant stream of new demand via adoption. Demand increases because the longer Bitcoin exists, the risk no longer outweighs reward among more and more potential market participants. As such, the simple passage of time at a particular price can drive demand.

**Derivatives Markets**

One of the more entertaining correlations is that the price appears to follow the lunar cycle. In actuality, I believe the monthly expiration dates in the derivatives market have lined up with the lunar cycle over the past few months, and not the other way around. But maybe there is something to the lunar cycle as well? 😄

Futures markets can have the effect of supressing volatility as market makers rebalance their spot and cash positions. However, the clearest tug-of-war between market makers is seen in the Option markets. On Deribit Metrics, after setting an expiration date, you see that they calculate the “Max Pain” price, the price of Bitcoin that would lead to option contract holders to lose the most amount of money. This would be the optimal outcome if you are writing these contracts, as you make money writing and selling them hoping they expire worthless.


The influence market makers have on the market may not even be “conscious” in the sense it is outright manipulation, the “Max Pain” price happens to be an equilibrium where market makers may not feel the need to further rebalance their spot and cash positions, leading the price to settle there naturally.

The “Max Pain” price will move around throughout the month as contracts are bought and sold. If you observe the spot price, it does appear to increase from contract close at end of the month to mid-month, and then begins to move towards the “Max Pain” price at month’s end.

Deribit and CME Group expirations have the largest volume, which occur 8:00 UTC and 15:00 UTC respectively on the last Friday of the month. As the price trade sideways, these are the critical dates to look out for.

**May is the new April?**

One last thought, the tax filing deadline in the US has moved from mid-April to mid-May. Could later than usual tax returns be a source of funds that flow into Bitcoin a bit later than has happened historically? My fingers are crossed that May is the new April and I will return to tracking the storm.

Ok, that is it for the monthly weather report. So far it looks like Bitcoin has found a comfortable price in the $50k-$60k region. If the price begins to increase exponentially in the future, I will begin tracking it again with the LPPL model. Otherwise, hope you May is great!

05/04/21,"Bitcoin fell on Tuesday, reaching up to the $57K level before pulling back, bouncing off the 50 Day EMA and closing the daily candle under $55K. This is a bearish candle as BTC continues to struggle around the 50 Day EMA, indicating a possible break lower.

(May 4, 2021  8:30PM EST)

[CHART HERE]

## Short-Term: 

If Bitcoin breaks below the 50 Day EMA, we'll be looking for support levels at $50K and \~$47K, a fib retracement. Ultimately, there is a ton of bullish fundamentals that should buoy Bitcoin in the event of any dip or market correction: the lower BTC goes, the greater a chance of a bounce. It's worth noting that BTC has not yet tested the 200 Day EMA as support yet during this bull market cycle, however the 50 Day EMA has typically been a more reliable indicator as a support level/buying area as it is more frequently touched. However, we have to acknowledge that BTC **can** drop to $45K or even $40K to test support. I think this is likely to be extraordinarily supportive with a ton of buying pressure, assuming we even drop that low, which I think is less likely.





**It's during times like these that we have to step back and consider all our investment criteria:** 

Have the fundamentals changed? 

Has supply/demand changed? 

Has government regulation changed?

**The answer to all of the above? No.** 

In this case, this is a BTFD scenario in a bull market unless proven otherwise. In fact, the macro uptrend is not in question unless Bitcoin breaks below $40K and ultimately the 200 Day EMA around $35K, which should be our absolute floor at this point. As long as we stay above these levels, we're in bullish territory.

It's easy to let bearish sentiment distract from your vision if you don't have a sound technical strategy. 20-30% drops are significant and not uncommon in crypto, so it's especially important to zoom out and look at the charts to keep the bigger picture in the front of your mind. 

RSI has fallen again, currently at 44 on the daily chart and has been in a downtrend for nearly a month now. 



## Bitcoin Dominance: 

Bitcoin Dominance broke below a major price area, dropping to about 46% as BTC continues to surrender crypto market cap to ETH and other altcoins. The next area to watch would be the 40% level which is roughly where Bitcoin peaked during the 2017 bull market. 

Now, that's not to say that Bitcoin is necessarily about to peak or already has. In fact, when you look at a longer term BTC.D chart, you'll see that Bitcoin has gradually lost dominance to other projects over time as the crypto ecosystem continues to evolve and flourish. This is not necessarily bearish for BTC, however it's worth watching. 



## Support: 50 Day EMA around $53,125, then $50K.

## Resistance: $60K, then $70K, $80K, then $100K. ",0.049,0.865,0.086,0.9405

Here is a very basic chart for you on Bitcoin. When you want to get clarity, simply switch to weekly timeframe and things will be very easy to spot.

What I see is a bullish price action (higher lows!) with some bearish indicators on weekly, but these indicators are already bullish on daily and this bias is slowly moving to 3 day view and then eventually will reach weekly again.

To solidify this bias, price has to do one thing and one thing only. Move above $58k. As soon as we move above this level, we're turning very bullish and $80k - $100k will become our next major target.

The price action is bullish because our previous week closed with a bullish engulfing candle (green body engulfed the previous red candle) and bounced PERFECTLY on the $48k support.

This weekly candle is still to close and we have plenty of days for it to go either way. For now this latest weekly candle shows bulls and bears have found an equilibrium (looks like a doji ), but one will eventually prevail. It can also signal consolidation before we break above $58k.

The bear case has to keep price under $58k and then push us under $48k to set a lower low. I find this very unlikely when ETH does a new ATH every day...

Therefore, the most probable scenario is that we will break above $58k this week, if not this week next week and then pump towards $100k.

So the algorithm is essentially listening to price changes in the last 5 minutes for all the coins on Binance. Once it detects that some coins have moved by more than 3% in the last 5 minutes, it takes this as a strong bullish signal and places a trade.

The algo is also able to store each bought coin in a local file and to track the performance of each trade placed so that it can perform stop loss and take profit actions and sell the coins that reach those thresholds.

Here's a more in-depth look at the bot parameters:

* By default we’re only picking USDT pairs
* We’re excluding Margin (like BTCDOWNUSDT) and Fiat pairs
* The bot checks if the any coin has gone up by more than 3% in the last 5 minutes
* The bot will buy 100 USDT of the most volatile coins on Binance
* The bot will sell at 6% profit or 3% stop loss

05/11/21,"Hey Everyone,

Long time lurker, first time contributor. With all the interesting news going on about Dogecoin and Ethereum lately, I’m noticing a much larger interest in people investing. Of course I’m a huge proponent of people investing and making huge profits in the process, but what worries me is people YOLOing substantial amounts of money into products they don’t understand. Prices fluctuate, volatility is immense, and most people don’t even understand how cryptocurrency functions.

So for any of those that are relatively new to cryptocurrency, here’s a post to highlight some of the basics. I've also made a video but I'm afraid of this post being confused for self promotion so check out my bio or PM me with questions.

What is cryptocurrency:

Cryptocurrency is a digital, decentralized currency, based on blockchain technology to buy and sell goods

What is decentralized?  
Decentralized means there’s no central authority controlling the money supply.

In the United States, the federal reserve controls the money supply to influence interest rates and inflation. With Decentralization, that central authority doesn’t exist, and the entirety of all transactions for cryptocurrency are kept on the blockchain.

What is blockchain?

Blockchain is an open, distributed ledger, written in code. When a purchase is made using cryptocurrency, the details of that transaction are written on the blockchain. The entirety of the ledger is hosted on a peer-to-peer network, meaning multiple copies holding the details of that transaction are hosted on multiple computers. Those details are public information that can be looked up, and immutable, meaning they can never change once they’ve occured. This structure is what allows cryptocurrency to be decentralized, practically immune to cyberattacks, and a viable option to be a globalized standard.

What influences the price of cryptocurrency?

Supply and Demand:

Most cryptocurrencies have a fixed supply and an overwhelming demand. Because of this, the price of cryptocurrencies will gradually get pushed up until there’s an equilibrium. Because so many investors have FOMO about the incredible gains cryptocurrencies have produced, literally nothing about the cryptocurrency needs to change for the price to get pushed up if there’s an overwhelming amount of people that want it.

Adoption:

As more merchants are willing to accept cryptocurrency as a form of payment, the currency begins to garner intrinsic value. Today, many popular corporations are starting to accept Bitcoin as a valid form of payment, and many more are considering it for future use

Regulation:

Even though cryptocurrencies are a decentralized platform, many governments have shown support or resistance to them. In the United States for example, legislation has been created to tax capital gains from cryptocurrencies, financial institutions are now allowed to include cryptocurrencies in some portfolios, and more. As more legislation comes out that supports or hinders the growth of cryptocurrency, the price is generally very volatile on the days of that announcement.

There’s plenty of more information that I could dive into, but hopefully this provides a solid framework for anyone new to crypto and is looking to grasp the basics.",0.024,0.844,0.132,0.9947

Bitcoin has tanked 13% yesterday on the news that Elon Musk is discontinuing BTC payments for Tesla cars due to environment concerns... really? When they enabled this featured they did not know BTC is mined using electricity from... all sources?

Goes to show Elon did no due diligence. Or perhaps he just wants some cheap Bitcoin to accumulate?

Either way, price action is not looking that good for Bitcoin and one quick look at the BTC Dominance chart is all you need to do to realize we're not particularly bullish .

My bias for the short/medium term is somewhat bearish , however long term I remain bullish so long we don't fall under the 200 Moving Average (the line in blue).

Why am I bearish in the nearby future?

1. We broke BELOW the 50 (yellow line) and 100 (green line) Moving Averages on daily. So long we cannot recover or push above these levels, it's hard to be bullish .

2. Do I see right? A lower high and a lower low??? See yellow arrows, this is a bearish signal. This is quite a reversal from a bullish trend that has higher lows and higher highs... Another lower low or lower high and we will be in trouble as the trend may reverse, at least in the medium term.

3. Daily indicators are flat (no trend here), however, on weekly timeframe , the indicators and particularly MACD is picking up speed and expanding downwards... this is quite bearish and will require some serious buy pressure and pump to reverse it.

Any good news?

For now the $48k support level is holding, however we're forming a descending triangle (in blue) and if we re-test this support again and again we're likely to break down and fall towards $41k or around the 200 Moving Average in blue. That better hold, otherwise...

Otherwise, we may get a 2013 scenario with a double top .

Trading View: [

Bitcoin seems to want to close today's daily candle under this descending triangle in blue and below the key support at $48k. As soon as that happens, I believe we're clear to go lower and towards $41k which will be a key buy area for long term hold.

Therefore, save your cash for this scenario as we may re-visit lower levels and you don't want to miss such a buy opportunity. Alts may also drop lower on this move which can provide even better returns if bought at that time.

The $41k level is a very strong support as it coincides with three key levels (see in yellow 1, 2, 3):

1. Previous high from Jan 2021 which will be retested as support;

2. The 200 Moving Average will reach a price around $40-41k which is likely to provide support at that level as well;

3. The Fib 38.2 retracement is at $41k which is usually a decent level to buy at in a bullish market (compared to the current top / ATH ).

Such a drop would be a -35% from our current ATH , nothing too concerning and pretty common in a bull market considering the past. My only concern is if the 50 MA (yellow line) will do a bearish cross / death cross with the 100 MA (green line). That is usually a long term bear indicator... So buying at $41k has some risk due to that.

Yassine-Elmandjra By Yassine Elmandjra | @yassineARK
Analyst

On Wednesday, roughly three months after its $1.5 billion investment in bitcoin, CEO Elon Musk announced on Twitter that Tesla will not accept bitcoin for the purchase of its vehicles any longer, citing concerns about Bitcoin mining’s reliance on fossil fuels. That said, Tesla is not selling any of the bitcoin on its balance sheet.

Tesla’s decision seems to have been triggered by private equity firm Greenidge’s plans to revive a coal power plant to mine bitcoin. Elon Musk referenced the announcement in a tweet. Subsequently, Greenidge clarified not only that its plant is powered by natural gas and feeds the grid but also that it bought carbon credits to offset the emissions.

In our view, the concerns around Bitcoin’s energy consumption are misguided. Contrary to consensus thinking, we believe the impact of bitcoin mining could become a net positive to the environment. With real-world data, we demonstrate how mining could impact the amount of renewable energy provisioned to the grid by transforming intermittent power resources into baseload generation by way of energy storage. We illustrate that renewables would be able to satisfy only 40% of the grid’s needs in the absence of Bitcoin mining but 99% with the commercial “subsidies” associated with Bitcoin mining.

There are many reasons you shouldn't short Bitcoin, the main reason is that the market is impossible to time. Shorting BTC can be as volatile as buying a shitcoin. But here are my reasons for those who are either interested or not.

With the torrent of bad news and FUD it seems that new money adoption of BTC is slowing down. Most new money is moving to other networks. This may seem obvious and I'm pretty sure someone will find a way to tell me I'm wrong on this, that's beside the point.

I frequent circles of ""investors"" and the prominent idea now is to invest in shitcoins or alts. You will find that new money in BTC is now a minority if you go around the web and see the sentiment.

Add to this that the price has fallen from 60k to 42k as of the time of writing, this may or may not indicate a bigger correction. I'm personally betting on a 30k BTC.

Some would call me crazy if I posted the same when BTC was still in the 50k, now its almost about to go under 40k and I was already called a fool. I don't really mind. I have thick skin from years of crypto and a 30k BTC is my forecasting. The short is leveraged up to 4x so I might get liquidated. Lets see how it pays off.

Approximately one year after the june 9 2016 halvening at $575 was june 2017 and had a similar peak of about 6x the halvening price then drop of about 1/3 from $2800 to about $1900. in september 2017 or three months later it was about $4700 . by december 2017 it was around 20,000 which is about 4x from september $4700

----compare to now----

we are 1 yr from the may 2020 halvening at around $8800 and we had a peak of about 6x the halvening price at about $60,000 and about a 1/3 drop from the peak to about $44,000.

If the 2016 halvening pattern held true then in about three more months from now or about August 2021 it would about 2.5x $44,000 which would be about $100,000 and then in 3 more months or around November 2021 it would about 4x which would be about $400,000. That's IF that pattern holds true.

If bitcoin had that same market cap then each Bitcoin would be about $11,000,000,000/21,000,000 (somebody double check my zeros) or about $523,000 per Bitcoin.

So we would still not be at Gold Market cap if bitcoin hit $400,000 later this year in November and many people think that is sort of a minimum spot for Bitcoin to end up as Bitcoin is better than Gold for most things gold is monetized for as a store of value and hedge against Fiat inflation.",0.013,0.942,0.044,0.8625

And if you sell now you pay tax and will incorrectly guess reentry so little to gain by selling now. Much possibly to lose by missing a possible halvening timeline of another 10x.

the halvening timeline would suggest a much bigger peak is coming and this is just the 1 yr june 2017 loss cycle before the big skyrocket.

and if you beleive in pi cycles you should have sold at $60,000 or so. now its already lost about 1/2 of that and based on 2018 might go down temporarily to 1/2 again or about 1/4 of pi cycle top. so if you sell now after you pay taxes and then guess imperfectly at when to buy back in then you really don't save much by selling at this point. but if it ISNT the pi cycle and its actually one yr after the halvening cycle like june 2017 was then you will miss the largest part of the bull run.

So little to gain by selling now. Much possibly to lose.Remember crypto doesnt go to zero. So you dont save your whole balance by selling.  and you have an immediate tax cost and then another loss tryign to get back in after its gone back up some to make yourself think the bottom is over.

The algo was designed to look for all the coins on Binance and pick the most volatile ones in a given timeframe, in order to automatically buy the ones which are likely to keep increasing in price. It's been tested by over 300 people and some reported double digit % increase in a day while others reported equal losses, so take that for what you will.

Here's a breakdown of the configuration (everything can be adjusted by the user)

* The bot will listen to changes in price across all Coins on Binance paired to USDT
* By default Margin (like BTCDOWNUSDT) and Fiat pairs are excluded
* The bot checks if the any coin has gone up by more than 3% in the last minute
* The bot will buy 15 USDT of the most volatile coins on Binance
* The bot will sell at 2% profit or 2% stop loss

Now all these configurations above are customisable, you can input any values you like it you are interested in trying out a different strategy. In fact you should actually be experimenting with it as no two strategies are equal. But use the test environment.

The dev community has contributed with some more major updates like:

* Trailing stop loss - the stop loss will move up and follow the price -2% (configurable), which essentially allows the bot to maximise the profit in a bull run, as long as it continues
* Better testing - the bot is able so simulate real-life trades and store the output in a file to determine whether your configuration is profitable.
* Additional modular signals!

If you are interested in testing, using or contributing to the code here is the official GitHub Repo:

There are rumors that TSLA bought in around December 2020, at the price of $20k. 

Considering that TSLA also sold around 300M worth of BTC at the top and putting everything together, it seems TSLA’s purchase price lies around $20k-$30k.

Seeing the recent dip in prices got me thinking about the irrational fear in the markets which cost a lot of retail investors a lot of money. I thought about how this could be ameliorated in the future to help avoid big venture capitalists and corporations buying up the dips and removing capital from small investors. I am a data scientist, have a PhD in Machine Learning, and studied Cognitive Systems at university, so I came up with the following idea:

With a clear mind, people usually make better decisions than when being afraid. Concerning cryptocurrency, good decisions are historically based on an optimistic outlook concerning its value. If people that are considered by some to be authorities start to display a negative sentiment, however, many retail investors don't think they can trust their own assessment anymore. Some might even say FUD is spread intentionally to be able to buy assets from retail investors that those public figures previously missed out on.

Remembering your own positive outlook is hard enough during times where everyone screams ""crisis!"" Not knowing the sentiment of all the other retail investors makes it just the harder. Saving those predictions and making them publicly available can help keep a cool head and look a few weeks into the future instead of taking a loss that might have been avoidable.

I'm in the first stages of implementing a project that enables the sourcing of predictions of small crypto investors. I am trying to figure out a blockchain implementation of this project, an incentive model, and how to avoid manipulation.

To see whether the idea can actually be realized the way that I imagine it, however, I need some data. Specifically, I need your predictions on the price of crypto assets (just Bitcoin for the time being). You can enter your predictions in this form: [

Everybody who contributes data will receive a link to all the predictions, to be able to make up their own mind on whether it contains any valuable information. If I manage to extract actually useful information, I'll send it out as well.

In the past few days, one retard made a few 25x threads without intentionally indicating his entry price and later claiming that the trades were successful. If you look at the time of his postings and BTC price movements after that, it's obvious he would have been liquidated for every 25x trade that he'd enter.

It's possible to correctly guess which way we are heading, but it's virtually impossible to time an entry with a 25-125x leverage. A tiny wick into the opposite direction and you lose everything, even if you were correct overall. These leverages exist purely to make the exchanges rich, not for the benefit of the traders. A casino always wins, remember? 

Noobs may read his posts and get a false impression that ""if he can do it, I surely can too"". While their first testing trade may even be successful, they will get liquidated on the second/third attempt, and hopefully they didn't YOLO their life savings into it. 

So it would be wonderful if in the mods could remove the supposedly successful 10-125x threads that do not have entry price/time, also posted within minutes of having made that very trade.

The breakdown point was spot on.

Inefficient, thin move. Gap, likely to be filled.

Slow grind down = More concerning

05/24/21,"Hello everyone! I decided to share a small article about copy trading, I hope it will be useful to someone)

How is copy trading different from investing with a financial advisor?

In the first case, the trader's funds remain in his account, and there is no need to transfer them to the account of a financial advisor. In the second case, the funds are transferred to the account of the consultant, and he already trades them on the market.

How does it work and where to trade?

You can mirror transactions yourself by observing famous traders. But this is quite difficult, because in this case, you yourself duplicate traders' orders on your exchange account. And you can only check the quality of such signals by trial and error on your own capital.

The second way is to use special copy-trading platforms that have the functionality of copying transactions of professionals. Their plus is that you can evaluate a trader's strategy using charts and service indicators without investing your own funds. Typically such platforms are used for automatic copying.

For the traditional market, there are such platforms as [Etoro] [myfxbook]

And on the cryptocurrency market, you can use [Coinmatics] services. [Coinmatics] is great for beginners, as you can test copy trading for free there, and the minimum deposit for copying is low. Very simple interface. For example, you can find a trader [alts wong trader] and see his profit in the profile (+ 200%), you can decide who you subscribe to.

The general mechanism of all copy trading platforms can be described as follows: register on the platform, bind the crypto exchange API key and subscribe to any trading strategy you like.

What are the opportunities offered by platforms with copy trading support?

There are a lot of opportunities - it all depends on the specific site. Only those experienced crypto traders who are allowed to do it themselves can copy transactions. On platforms with copy trading, it is usually possible to track the most successful deals on exchanges and only then select the trader you like and copy his strategy and deals.

Who is copy trading suitable for?

We will mean not a professional trader, but a trader who copies trades. Copy trading, as we have already said, is suitable for inexperienced traders, traders with limited time or lazy traders who do not want to analyze the market.",0.043,0.849,0.108,0.9853

05/25/21,"#How Crypto Derivatives Crashed the Market – Do Prices Signal Buy Bitcoin?#


Wondering why bitcoin lost 50% of its value in less than a week – blame it on crypto derivatives, or at least partly.

Data from the top crypto derivatives trading venues shows that on 18 May liquidations amounting to $8.61 billion. As you would expect, the vast majority of those liquidations were longs ($7.56 billion v $1.05 billion shorts, by value).

Traders’ positions are automatically closed when a margin call cannot be met, which is what makes playing in the crypto futures market such a high-risk endeavour, due to the outsized volatility of price movements.

Back in the day the prospect of crypto derivatives products being launched – regulated and unregulated – had crypto traders salivating and more staid observers touting the emergence of such products as an indication of a maturing sector.

Just to remind the uninitiated, crypto derivatives trading on margin magnifies your gains – but it is also the mother of nose-bleeding losses.

#Crypto derivatives ‘exacerbated’ meltdown#

Joel Edgerton, chief operating officer of crypto exchange bitFlyer, concurs regarding the role played by the derivatives markets, in remarks made available to insidebitcoins: “This meltdown is exacerbated by the high leverage used in unregulated exchanges and the liquidations we are seeing in the market.

“Any buying into the drops is like catching a falling knife, which moves the buyers to the sidelines to wait for a bottom. We will need to find a bottom and consolidate the price before we see stability.”

#Is $30k or $40k the bottom for bitcoin?#

Bitcoin and the wider crypto market are bouncing back today, in moves that aspire to be as dramatic as the brutal downdraft. Bitcoin is up 16% at $41,800 at the time of writing.

The leading crypto asset has traded as low as $30,000 and that could be the real bottom and not $40,000 currently being hoped for, although bitcoin, as mentioned, has recovered impressively from yesterday’s visits to the $30k resistance line.

However, the 200-day moving average at $40,000 (green line in chart below) could yet be the new lower band for a period of (wide) rangebound trading. Traders are currently looking for the price to hold above $42,000 today for confirmation that a bottom could be in, but as Edgerton intimates, you would be playing Russian Roulette placing your buy bitcoin chips on those hopes.

 

If the bitcoin price can tee-up to challenge $48,000 (see chart below) in the next few days, then the drop to $30,000 can be laid to rest as a bad memory not to be revisited.

But relying on the charts alone to divine the next price moves for those looking to buy bitcoin is not a full-spectrum approach.

As Edgerton reminds us, we got here because of negative news flow in addition to factors such as the US tax season and the perennial doubts surrounding the collateralisation of Tether (USDT).

“A perfect storm of negative stories (Elon going negative on BTC, Binance facing possible US regulatory penalties, tax season selling, USDT asset backing is riskier than expected) is swamping crypto and generating severe fear, particularly among retail traders,” says Edgerton.

 

#Crypto derivatives blow up: understanding gamma hedging and other intricacies of crypto derivatives#

But let’s dig a bit deeper into the derivatives data. The leverage on the longs is straightforward to grasp for those unfamiliar with derivatives trading. But there are some other accelerants in the mix that stem from the strategies sophisticated pro derivatives traders use as a matter of course when playing the markets.

Shane Ai, Head of Product R&amp;D at crypto derivatives exchange Bybit, has shined light on the matter: “This week’s rapid correction resulted from a perfect storm of the following: leveraged long liquidations, option dealer put gamma hedging, and spot selling from cash and carry unwinds.”

If your eyes glaze over when letters of the Greek alphabet appear in financial speak, we are here to help.

The gamma hedging Ai refers to is simply the practice of controlling for large movements in the underlying asset of an option. Put options are used to short a position, sometimes in order to hedge a long. Also, price volatility tends to increase the closer a contract gets to expiry, so gamma hedging finds a role in such circumstances too.

#Cash and Carry unwinds: when crypto arbitraging turns bad#

Cash and carry refers to strategies that seek to arbitrage the price difference between a derivative and the underlying asset it is based upon.

The strategy is usually constructed by taking a long position in the asset and a derivative in the opposite direction. But when bitcoin crashed, the profit on the price arbitrage would have disappeared, with losses on the spot far greater than the gains on the short position in the derivatives market.

So the drama of the past few days isn’t all on Elon Musk and the regulators in China and the US.

#Taproot: keep an eye on bitcoin fundamentals#

But zooming out from the market shenanigans, the last word should take us back to the relative sanity of the fundamentals, lest we forget what bitcoin is meant to be about, which is value storage and transfer in the digital realm (as opposed to a purely speculative asset).

On the subject of the fundamentals, it’s over to Edgerton at Japan-based crypto exchange Bitflyer: “Bitcoin the technology is moving forward with miners increasingly moving toward the Taproot upgrades which adds more value to the network.”

The operative phrase there is ‘moving forward’. Pound-cost average in. Accumulate. Hodl.

Market makers are closing out longs and building massive short positions within this distribution range. But the issue with only seeing this as accumulation/distribution is that it doesn't really tell you much about what is happening. Were all the other retracements we had the past few months distribution or accumulation? [

There was one significant difference in the distribution we saw around 60k that didn't happen on the other retracements (see the chart above for the retracements I am referring to.) The trend was lost. The other retracements didn't lose any significant levels on the higher time frame charts. The accumulation at 60k (most important part) lost the weekly move to the high in the trend. The last support before we created the all time high on the weekly was lost when we closed below it. [ . If we think about trend (higher highs and higher lows/ lower highs and lower lows) logically, for an uptrend to continue we need to make a higher low followed by a higher high and another higher low.. you get the point. At 60k, instead of holding a higher low, we made a new low and lost the most significant level which was the move to the high. If we think of trend logically, what will come next after make a new low? A lower high. We retraced up and tested resistance (some would call it a test of the left shoulder, I wouldn't for a few reasons. Not going to explain here) which created a lower high and dumped it down to new lows. [ . Bitcoin follows real TA and trend analysis very well.

I do some investing on the side and occasionally day trade. I wanted to get more into crypto besides just buying and holding. Day trading crypto doesn't seem super complicated as compared to trading options, there's just not as many moving parts. I know how volatile crypto markets are so I see this as an opportunity to really just trade on the price swings and build up the amount of coins I have over time.

I really don't have the time during the day to sit and watch the price movement of crypto to get in and out of the market. I heard of crypto trading bots before but I don't know much about them. I'll begin doing my own due diligence on bots after I'm done this post but I figured I'd ask the good ole reddit community for input since everyone knows this is where you find out the real info your looking for from experienced users.

When it comes to programming, I'm a beginner. I've only been working on learning C++ and I'm only 4 chapters in on my textbook teaching myself. These are kind of the parameters I am looking to fulfill:

1. **Ease of Use:** Preferably a bot that that had an easy to use UI that required the most minimal-none coding to program it.
2. **Exchange:** I typically use Coinbase, but the required exchange doesn't matter to me. If it can trade on multiple exchange that would be even more ideal because then I could try to arbitrage.
3. **Coin Traded:** I would like a bot that was not restricted solely to Bitcoin. I haven't made a solid decision on which coin I would like to trade and may even end up trading multiple coins. I would prefer a coin with a low $/coin cost so that I am able to acquire more coins for my $ and also be able to start with a larger sum to be able to grow faster.
4. **Cost:** If I could find a free to use bot, that would be dope. But if I have to pay for one, I don't mind. Something cost effective would be preferred, but I would rather pay more for a more effective bot.
5. **Strategy:** I would prefer a bot that could do all of the following, but if one doesn't exist, I would like to know what the options are for each strategy.  

   1. ***First:*** I'm trying to trade on small swings in price fluctuations, maybe start with 0.5%, then try 1%, then 1.5%, then 2%, same all the way up to 5%. I want to see which price movement to trade would be most profitable. Obviously a smaller % trade doesn't make as much money, but those swings are more likely to occur more often so it may add up to more coins being acquired in the long run than trying to get bigger % swings less often in the short run.
   2. ***Second:*** I want to try and day trade multiple different % fluctuations at once. So I would like a bot where I can run multiple instances of it at once, like opening several tabs in a browser. If this is not possible I'll probably just use multiple different bots at the same time. But if anyone knows how it works, I'd love your input.
   3. ***Third:*** I want to try to get into arbitraging. I don't know much about how that works, but I think it may be possible, correct me if I'm wrong.
   4. ***Fourth:*** After seeing which strategy is more lucrative, I would like to try a combination of both day trading price fluctuations (single and multiple instances) and also arbitraging at the same time.
   5. ***Fifth:*** These are the only strategies that I know of, so if anyone has any other strategies that are possible, I'd love to hear from you on what your play is.

Any input/advice from ya'll on the bots that are out there and any that fulfill all/any of my needs would be greatly appreciated.

If anyone currently uses bots to trade, I'd like to hear from you on what is useful to know when getting into this, what coins are the best to trade, what strategies seem to work the best, and any other insight you can give to someone.

Thank you in advance for everyone that gives me some feedback.

06/06/21,I was wondering if there was a platform that has a forum based discussions but is also integrated with crypto trading tools. Something like finary.io but for crypto. I've been looking for ways to talk about crypto trading on a dedicated platform but I can't seem to find anything.

06/06/21,"I have to say, I did not expect this to get so much attention so thanks guys for getting involved in this and trying out the bot. Many of you have raised concerns that the bot is quite hard to set-up and operate, so there are some pretty cool news that I would like to share.

With over 1.2k people on our server talking, testing and adding their input on the crypto trading algorithm, and 2.1k stars on GitHub it's clear that this project has massively outgrown its initial bounds.

If you're not sure what this is all about let me quickly break it down for you before I go on:

This is a crypto trading engine that analyses all coins on Binance and detects the most volatile ones in order to catch a potential mooning.

* The bot will listen to changes in price across all Coins on Binance paired to USDT
* There is a sandbox mode to test our different strategies
* A pause mode, to stop buying once the market goes bearish

This just a configuration example, and you should experiment with these parameters to figure out what works for you. In addition to that the bot supports technical analysis, as a secondary buying strategy.

For example, the bot can be configured to buy a coin if 18 out 26 technical indicators are showing a strong buy signal.

While this is quite a powerful tool in itself, many of you encountered issues with downloading and running the code in a Python compiler.

I'm excited to say that we are now a team of developers, and not just myself working on this project, and we're working on a more full fledged version of this bot with a proper front-end for config editing, profit loss tracking and more. This is huge as it allows us to add more powerful features onto it.

If you're interested in the project and would like to be part of the early access, head over here and register your interest: [

If you want to know more about it, or try out the initial version available as open source code, see this link: [ It contains some useful links to guides and more resources

Lastly, if you're great with coding and just want to play around with the code, no fluff see the GitHub repo: [",0.025,0.837,0.138,0.9919
06/07/21,"We all know there are 1+ million bitcoins sitting in Satoshi's cold storage that have not been touched since the day they were mined. Despite the insane price appreciation, no-one has seemed tempted to cash out. It is possible, I suppose, that the creator of bitcoin has such a strong ideological attachment to the concept they don't wish to spoil the party so to speak. 

But I don't buy that. There's plenty of evidence that it was a collaborative project. Such a huge amount of the coin would be bound to cause disagreements and someone would eventually let the cat out of the bag IMO. Unless of course they were working under the auspices of a large organisation or government that actually has control of the bitcoin. Lets be honest the US gov blows a lot of hot air about regulation, but has never earnestly tried to suppress it's growth. 

This would be bullish in that clearly whoever controls the BTC expects it to continue to displace other assets and perhaps reach the 10 million price that I believe Hal Finney (probably a collaborator) mentioned. Now that we are seeing smaller economies adopt bitcoin, it's very possible whoever controls that Bitcoin can use it as a geopolitical weapon in future

Another argument is that US intelligence would without a doubt have identified the creator of Bitcoin by now anyway, and possibly effectively commandeered the BTC in exchange for protecting their identity. This would have been made a priority since the silk road days and FBI bust",0.041,0.815,0.144,0.9758

The articles of the bill say that in 90 days from the publication of this bill (assuming today) everyone in the country must accept bitcoin as currency for all debts both public and private.  It says that there is no capital gains on bitcoin there because it is a currency. It even says that there will be some sort of a fund holding reserves of bitcoin!

Bottom line: El Salvador is buying \~$150mm worth of BTC to add to its treasury very soon and everyone in El Salvador (7 million ppl?) will all be carrying bitcoin on their phones in 90 days from now and paying for everything over the lightning network.

06/13/21,"I think the move to make Bitcoin legal tender in El Salvador is not a move towards global financial freedom but has two very specific purposes and I fear it will have only one result.

**Purpose #1**

Attracting capitals to El Salvador, especially from exchanges which are the real and only market that always and in any case earns, with mechanics very similar to gambling.

**Purpose #2**

Making Bitcoin a legal tender currency makes it in effect a foreign currency in other countries, consequently it will change the taxation on the capital gain.

**Result**

Due to the high fees, high confirmation times (unless you pay those high fees) and Segwit+RBF that prevent zero confs, the experience of El Salvadorians will be very bad.

It will be realized that Bitcoin is impossible to use as a national currency and the experiment will fail miserably, so that one can then generalize by saying that cryptocurrencies do not function as legal tender.

06/21/21,"The decision by El Salvador was a big decision with far-reaching implications for its citizens. However, it is possible the decision could significantly impact individuals subject to the United States Internal Revenue Code. All US guidance issued to date have correctly pointed out that bitcoin is not the legal tender of any jurisdiction (see [FIN-2013-G001] and [Notice 2014-21] This statement will soon not be true!

The US government has used the legal tender distinction as a way to apply a different set of rules to “virtual” currency compared to “real” currency. It has been the government’s view to date that “virtual” currency, a term that currently encompasses cryptocurrency and bitcoin, is [property] and the taxation rules related to [property] apply. The question being pressed by El Salvador’s decision to adopt bitcoin as legal tender is does El Salvador’s decision have any impact on how bitcoin is treated by the IRS?

The IRC does not specifically define currency. However, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), a bureau of the Department of Treasury, has frequently referenced the FinCEN regulations to define “real” currency. The regulations’ definition of currency, frequently referred to as “real” currency in FinCEN and IRS guidance, is stated at [31 CFR section 1010.100(m)] and includes the money of the United States. Additionally, “real” currency includes the money of any other country that satisfies the following criteria:

1. Is designated as legal tender
2. That circulates
3. Is customarily used and accepted as a medium of exchange 
4. In the country of issuance.

The remainder of this article will analyze El Salvador’s new bitcoin law to determine if bitcoin will now be considered a “real” currency based on the four criteria listed above.

*Is designated as Legal Tender*

The El Salvador bitcoin law specifically states that the country is designating bitcoin as legal tender. Additionally, the law is following the commonly used definition of legal tender. According to Merriam-Webster legal tender means “money that is legally valid for the payment of debts and that must be accepted for that purpose when offered.” The El Salvador bitcoin law has specific articles that address the topics required by the legal tender definition. Therefore, it is hard to dispute that this part of the “real” currency definition is satisfied by the El Salvador law.

*That Circulates*

To meet the “circulates” criteria bitcoin should be moving in an orderly manner throughout the El Salvador monetary ecosystem. The law clearly states that the country will accept bitcoin as payment for taxes. However, more time will be needed to see how much bitcoin circulates throughout the ecosystem. The more widespread and ubiquitous the adoption is in the country, the more likely this part of the “real” currency definition will be satisfied. The monetary ratio of transactions and taxes paid in bitcoin verse USD will be informative for this inquiry once bitcoin is official legal tender in El Salvador. Additional factors to examine would be the country paying wages exclusively in bitcoin and settling outstanding debts in bitcoin.

*Is Customarily Used and Accepted as a Medium of Exchange*

Similar to the “circulates” criteria above, we will have to see how common bitcoin is in the El Salvador monetary ecosystem in the coming months. While the law requires bitcoin to be accepted by entities in El Salvador, the law excludes that requirement on entities who do not have the technology to carry out bitcoin transactions. Furthermore, El Salvador will automatically and instantaneously convert bitcoin into USD for entities that wish. While bitcoin is clearly going to be a part of the El Salvador monetary ecosystem, only time will tell how common bitcoin transaction will be in the country’s monetary ecosystem. Similar to our discussion related to the “circulates” criteria above, the monetary ratio of transactions in bitcoin verse USD will be an important metric to assess whether this criteria is satisfied.

*In the Country of Issuance*

While the fourth criteria has not been separately discussed in government guidance to date (instead it has been included as part of the third criteria), the word issuance could be a word the government focuses its analysis on should the US government want to continue to treat bitcoin as [property] of “real” currency. While the country of El Salvador is adopting bitcoin as legal tender, it is not supplying or distributing any coins to its citizens. The President of El Salvador, Nayib Bukele, has ambitious plans to harness the country’s [geothermal volcanic energy to mine bitcoin] but that may fall short of the meaning of issuance as used in the “real” currency definition.

In the context of the “real” currency definition, it is plausible that the US government could require issuance to refer to the sole (or majority) creation and supply of the currency. Bitcoin would certainly fall short of this strict interpretation of the issuance criteria as mining has occurred all over the world since bitcoin’s first block was mined on January 3, 2009.

06/22/21,"**Global investment management firm VanEck has submitted a proposal to the U.S  Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), for a Bitcoin futures mutual fund**. 

## No Direct Investment in Bitcoin

In a Form N-1A filing with the SEC on Monday (June 21, 2021), VanEck stated that the Bitcoin Strategy Fund seeks to invest in bitcoin futures. The fund will also invest in pooled investment vehicles, along with exchange-traded products (ETP), with exposure to bitcoin. 

Also, the investment in bitcoin futures will be done via a limited company subsidiary that operates under the laws of the Cayman Islands.

 An excerpt from the prospectus reads:

 **“The Fund seeks to invest in Bitcoin Investments so that the total value of the bitcoin to which the Fund has economic exposure is approximately 100% of the net assets of the Fund.”**

 However, unlike VanEck’s previous applications, the Fund will not directly invest in bitcoin.

**“The Fund does not invest in, or seek exposure to, the current “spot” or cash price of bitcoin. Investors seeking direct exposure to the price of bitcoin should consider an investment other than the Fund”** 

VanEck’s Fund not directly investing in bitcoin could make the SEC speed up its decision on the company’s proposal. The investment management firm submitted several applications for a Bitcoin ETF in the past, with the American securities regulator delaying its decision, causing the company to withdraw its proposals.

VanEck decided to try again in December 2020. Later in March 2021, Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) filed a proposal to list the VanEck Bitcoin ETF. 

However, the company seems to be witnessing another series of delays. In April, the SEC announced it was postponing its decision on VanEck’s Bitcoin ETF till June. Later in June, the SEC delayed giving a decision for the second time, stating that it was seeking more comments. 

Meanwhile, VanEck earlier listed its crypto exchange-traded funds (ETP)  on the Euronext stock exchanges in Amsterdam and Paris, giving investors exposure to Bitcoin and Ethereum. Apart from VanEck’s application, several other Bitcoin ETF proposals await the SEC’s decision.

While the SEC continues to delay a BTC ETF, countries like Canada and Brazil already approved various Bitcoin ETFs. [",0.027,0.919,0.054,0.8481

(June 22, 2021  8:30PM EST)

## Short-Term

Bitcoin fell and recovered early in the week, giving us a bullish hammer on the weekly chart. If this was indeed this microcycle's low, then we could see sideways trading between $30K - $40K going forward while we build momentum back up. This is my primary view as there is a ton of buying pressure at and underneath $30K to further support strong fundamentals and recent price action. There has been a lot of intraday ""noise"" in the media (China FUD, Elon tweets, clean energy FUD, etc.) that has caused a lot of crypto noob selling, but long-term holders are not only HODLing but accumulating more than ever. Fear is high which typically indicates a bottom is near. This aligns with a 61.8% fib retracement of the September 2020-May 2021 rally, resembling that of the 2013 Bitcoin cycle when we had an early, mid-year ""top"" which later proved to be ""the first selloff."" 

If there's more pain to come, then we could see a drop down to the 78.6% fib retracement of the Sept '20 - May '21 rally around $21,637 which would assuredly get bought up as it hovers just above the 2017 highs which should provide massive support. This is not my primary view but it is possible given the current price action, and it's common for assets to retrace to former resistances to test support. If this happens, I expect a massive capitulation candle that results in a violent bounce back up to $30K or higher which should kickstart the next leg of the bull market rally. 

## BTC Dominance

Bitcoin Dominance continues to recover, rallying to nearly 48% amidst another crypto selloff as alts continue to suffer the brunt of the pain. Capital continues to rotate out of needlessly inflated alts back into the ""conservative"" mega-cap Bitcoin, which could help push Bitcoin dominance back up to 50 or even 60% by the time this short-term selloff and consolidation is over. 

## Long-Term

06/23/21,"In China, four provinces have already banned the mining of digital assets, and five of the country's largest banks have been banned from conducting operations related to cryptocurrencies. Experts explained what it will lead to and how it will affect quotations in the long term.

On June 21, the People's Bank of China held a meeting with the country's five largest banks and the Alipay payment system, during which it warned financial institutions against transactions related to cryptocurrency. Last month, Chinese authorities called for stricter regulation of mining and crypto-trading. Since then, four Chinese provinces have already banned mining of digital assets: Sichuan, Yunnan, Qinghai and Xinjiang.

During the month bitcoin fell in price by 18%, and on June 22, its value fell below $ 30,000 for the first time since January this year.

Given the volume of crypto market in China and the fact that the Celestial Empire sets the tone in the actions of the states in the Asia-Pacific region in many economic and political issues, the consequences for cryptocurrencies in the global plan will be serious, the head of the analytical department of AMarkets Artem Deev said.

The example of China in the near future may be followed by other states unfriendly to cryptocurrencies, said Director of Partnerships 1inch Network Nikita Ovchinnik. According to him, such measures may be taken by the countries of the Asian group, such as Japan, the Republic of Korea, India, as well as countries in Latin America.

Such a large-scale attack on the cryptocurrency market in China continues to increase pressure on the market, and the desire to regulate the cryptocurrency market will continue - neither the US nor the EU will be able to miss these events, especially when announcing their intentions to introduce their digital currencies, Deeev argues.

&gt;""This is not just a correction - a period of a long and deep fall is coming for the crypto market,"" explained the head of the analytical department of AMarkets.

In the long term, China's bans will certainly not bring anything good, but they will not be followed by any catastrophe, says Nikita Soshnikov, director of the cryptocurrency exchange service Alfacash. He predicted that the flow of Asian money to the crypto market will decrease, which will negatively affect the quotes.

&gt;""They have long ago learned to exist under strict bans on the movement of capital. The current bans will only delay a new round of bitcoin growth, but not cancel it,"" Nikita Soshnikov added.

06/26/21,"El Salvador made headlines when it announced plans to accept Bitcoin as a legal tender. Since then, the cryptocurrency industry in the nation has seen constant innovation. The latest development involves the installation of 1500 cryptocurrency-powered ATMs in the nation, courtesy of Crypto ATM manufacturer Athena Bitcoin.

**Making Bitcoin Accessible**

According to recent reports Athena Bitcoin intends to spend more than $1 million in El Salvador, particularly in areas where citizens get remittances from overseas, a business spokesman said on Thursday. Per the company’s website users may purchase bitcoins or sell them for cash using their ATMs.

The company intends to progressively install around 1,500 ATMs, recruit people, and establish an office in El Salvador, which became the first country to recognize bitcoin as legal money in June. The change is set to come into effect in September.

President Nayib Bukele “presented us with a tough challenge of 1,500 ATMs, we will go for that, but in phases. We are a private company and we want to ensure that our development in the country is sustainable,” commented the firm’s director for Latin America Matias Goldenhörn.

“Initially we’re going to have dozens of machines,\[we’ll\]test how the business model is in El Salvador, which will probably be different from the United States,” Goldenhorn added.

However, this isn’t going to be Athena’s first Bitcoin ATM in El Salvador. The firm placed its first cryptocurrency ATM a year ago at El Salvador’s El Zonte beach, around 49 kilometers (30 miles) southwest of the capital San Salvador, as part of an experiment called Bitcoin Beach aiming at establishing one of the world’s first bitcoin economies.

El Salvador’s president has lauded the flagship cryptocurrency’s potential as a means of remittance for Salvadorans living overseas.

The development isn’t just limited to Bitcoin ATMs in the nation, as President Bukele had announced earlier the nation would power its Bitcoin mining activities with geothermal energy from volcanoes. The move came in response to the recent concerns regarding the flagship crypto’s energy consumption and its impact on the environment.

**No Help**

The development also follows the World Bank asserting that it cannot help El Salvador given the environmental and transparency deficiencies in its bitcoin implementation. Meanwhile, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has said that it saw “macroeconomic, financial and legal issues” with the adoption of cryptocurrencies in the nation. [",0.016,0.914,0.069,0.9362

It's been a bearish start to summer but after suffering a &gt;50% retracement, it appears the majority of the selling is over with, assuming Bitcoin hasn't started a new macro bear market. By nearly every measure, Bitcoin is still in a long-term bull market cycle, the question now is whether the bottom is in following the nasty May selloff.Sellers are simply chasing the trade at this point; the point of least resistance over the med-long term is up. Short-term, one could argue the capitulation bottom was 2 weeks ago when Bitcoin fell to under $29K, then bounced up about $4K intraday. Alternatively, it could be argued that maximum pain would be a drop to $20K to retest the previous cycle's ATH, which would assuredly get bought up in a big way by, well, everyone. 

If there's more pain to come, then we could see a drop down to the 78.6% fib retracement of the Sept '20 - May '21 rally around $21,637 which would assuredly get bought up as it hovers just above the 2017 highs which should provide massive support.

**Fiat Is a Fraud, Buy Bitcoin**

Ricardo Benjamin Salinas Pliego, a Mexican billionaire businessman, founder, and chairman of Group Salinas, a group of firms involved in telecom, media, financial services, and retail services recently went on record to call fiat currencies a fraud. The business tycoon added bitcoin’s finite supply is the key to its success.

Salinas stated:

“The fiat fraud is inherent to the fiat system and we can see it today in the USA. Monetary issuance went to the moon, you understand? The dollar as hard money is a joke.”

Adding:

“I’ve invested a lot of time studying bitcoin and I think it’s an asset that should be part of every investor’s portfolio. It’s an asset that has value, international value, that is traded with enormous liquidity at a global level and that is enough reason for it to be part of every portfolio, period.”

Interestingly, Salinas focused on BTC’s finite supply as the “key part” for the premier cryptocurrency’s success. In contrast, Salinas highlighted ether’s (ETH) infinite supply as a major detrimental to its success. Commenting on ether’s infinite supply, Salinas said:

“That’s why I say about Ethereum, while they don’t have a finite supply, I don’t believe anything they do. For all I know, they emit more and your asset deprecates.”

06/30/21,"TL;DR: Buying far out of the money puts as insurance against big market drops + writing covered calls or selling puts as a yield enhancement strategy.

I see a lot of people whining day in day out about the current sideways market we are seeing in BTC and other cryptos while speculating about the support and resistance levels. Instead of just watching this market go nowhere and speculate about these levels, did you know you can actually make money out of this kind of market and also learn protect yourself if there’s another dip?

I wanted to write a more lengthy and detailed write up as to why fellow HODLers should use futures and options to both hedge (protect from market drops) their crypto investments and use yield enhancement strategies (generate income while HODLing) but I’m a bit short on time these days so I thought I would just put this out there and hopefully others can chime in. Time permitting I will try to write something up in the coming weeks.

Derivatives, options and futures can seem quite daunting and you can quickly get overwhelmed with the language and technical speak. If I can offer one piece of advice is to try to keep it simple - as soon as it gets too complicated just drop it and go back over the basics and something you understand. It could take years to become a specialist option trader and most of you probably don’t have the time or willingness to do so. I would also add that practice makes perfect - there’s a lot of theorising in option trading guides and it becomes very abstract. Having a hands-on approach you will learn just as much as what any book can teach you. In other words, start small, pay attention and see how prices move and. Obviously if you have the time and interest to take it further and develop a passion for options then there are tons of books, guides, blogs out there.

If you want to start looking at options I use two exchanges OKex and Deribit. I love the OKex app as it’s easy to use and has a great layout so it’s my got to app for futures / options prices and doing market research but I actually put all my trades through Deribit because it has the biggest market share in the crypto option space so has tighter spreads (prices) but the app is basic and doesn’t give you much else other than prices.

As HODLers we are in the best position to **write covered calls** (this is what all the most conservative and biggest asset managers and pension funds do to generate additional income) so this is a strategy you really want to look into. Additionally you can also try to learn about **selling puts**.

The second benefit about learning about options is to buy yourself some insurance. We would have all benefited from having some insurance when the market went from 60k to 30k. **Buying some far out of the money puts will give you that insurance** and you might even be able to get it for free since you will be paying for it using the money generated from the yield enhancement strategies.

Please feel free to post as many questions as possible as this will help me make a more lengthy write up later on and I'm sure others with knowledge on the subject can expand as well.

Bitcoin continues to consolidate in a tighter trading range. What was once a $10K trading range from $30K - $40K is now $30K - $35K.

A retest of the $30K level is well within sight over this long holiday weekend in the US.

But having said that, I will test the tool out and see what it can do - who knows, maybe among all the shills and moon-farmers is where insight truly lives.

**Here's a little bit about how it works:**

It's a trading bot that analyses reddit post sentiment and automatically buys the coins mentioned in the post. So it checks if the post title and body talk positively about x coin, and if that's the case it goes ham on that coin.

But it only does this for coins I tell it to look out for: by default it will only check BTC and ETH but you can add any number of keywords. This is built in to discourage shill exploits.

It also comes with several customisation options so you can choose how you want to use this:

1. Which subreddits it should look for
2. How to sort posts (hot by default)
3. How many posts from each sub will be analysed (by default 10)
4. What keywords it should be looking out for (default: Bitcoin and Ethereum)

You can also specify how often to check for posts, as well as the size of each trade placed.

I added a test mode so it can just simulate trades, so you can see how it would work in a live market, but without using real funds.

Looks like it bought BTC :)

The bot will also stop from buying or analysing posts while the same posts are in top/hot, to avoid re-buying on the same signal.

Here's the GitHub repo for the project:

07/05/21,"A Bitcoin on-chain metric, the Puell Multiple, temporarily fell to the “undervalued zone” before snapping back as BTC prices recovered, data from GlassNode on July 5 shows.

**The Puell Indicator Falling in lockstep with Bitcoin Hash Rate**

According to a screen-grab, the indicator has been used by on-chain analysts to pick out bottoms on several occasions.

Often, sharp contractions to undervalued zone precedes a fulfilling rally in a price action equilibrium discovery where Bitcoin’s value is repriced significantly higher.

However, the correction of the Puell Multiple—an indicator by David Puell—can be used to pick out deep undervaluation of Bitcoin prices caused in part primarily by disturbances in the critical Bitcoin mining scene.

Typically, the indicator is a ratio between the daily BTC emission in USD and the 365-day moving average of the issuance value. Whenever the ratio falls below 0.5, analysts interpret it to mean BTC in circulation is comparatively cheaper than historical standards.

Aforementioned, the indicator has been used before with great accuracy.

Specifically, the coincidence of critical events in Bitcoin’s history with the deep contraction of the Puell Multiple below 0.5 offers guidance. In one way, the indicator can be highlighting the level of miner liquidation.

Often a sell-off within normal ranges won’t drastically affect BTC price movements.

However, in extraordinary cases, miners rushing to exchanges and liquidating their stash could mean duress. In turn, this often is subsequential to the entire BTC and crypto mining ecosystem.

**Cryptocurrency Mining in China**

Analysts are pinning the fall of the Puell Multiple to the crackdown of crypto and Bitcoin mining activities in China.

Over the past few weeks, mining hubs in various regions, including Xinjiang and Sichuan, as BTCManager reports, were ordered to close down.

This, in turn, had a profound effect on the Bitcoin network’s hash rate—a metric used to measure the platform’s computing power and, by extension, miner commitment.

Bitcoin hash rate plunged from 171 EH/s to around 55 EH/s by the tail-end of June.

This has since recovered, but the effect can be felt, especially as there were delays in transaction confirmation times before the relieving mining difficulty adjustment.

Following the recalibration over the weekend, the Bitcoin network eased the hash rate by 28 percent, making mining relatively easier and profitable.

07/06/21,"Bitcoin failed to overcome the mark of $36k again, then its rate rolled back. Why the price of asset may fall to $23k and in what case it will rise to $47k?

On Monday night, the rate of Bitcoin reached the mark of $35.9k, after which it began to decline. As of 20:10 EEST time, the price of the first cryptocurrency is $33.6k — it has fallen by 5% over the past 24 hours.

Bitcoin continues to maintain the downward trend, the next levels of $27k and $23k, says Anton Kravchenko, Xena Financial Systems CEO. According to him, the rate of decline has slowed significantly and the market is waiting for the turning point, but it is not yet known at what level it will happen.

Cryptorg crypto exchange CEO Andrey Podolyan has a contrary opinion, who does not expect bitcoin to update the local minimum. Podolyan believes that some big players have already accumulated enough volume to buy in the area of $30–33k and in July at the breakdown of $36k upward a powerful impulse movement with the first target around $40–41k and the second target around $45–47k should develop.

&gt;*“At these marks bitcoin will slow down and there will probably be another attempt at a strong decline. Cancellation of the scenario for me will be the departure of BTC below $29k,” — the expert warned.*

Without favorable signals crypto market will remain volatile, there may be small fluctuations both up and down, head of analytical department of AMarkets Artem Deev added. According to him, one of the drivers for short-term growth from the current $34.5k to $37–38k dollars may become information from reports on the U.S. labor market or interest in the cryptocurrency from large investors. They remain silent so far, assessing the risks of stricter legislation in developed countries (for example, states may follow the example of China), Deev says.

Summer is a period of low activity, so the director of the financial company Newcent Vladimir Smetanin suggested that in July bitcoin will remain in the corridor of $30–40k, as all the positive and negative news have already played out.

Earlier, Santiment analytical service reported that Bitcoin volume on cryptocurrency exchanges fell to a six-month low. Analysts believe this should be seen as a “promising sign” that points to a reduced risk of larger sales of the cryptocurrency.

Typically, a decline in bitcoin stocks on cryptocurrency exchanges indicates the accumulation of digital coins by large holders (called “whales”). Santiment analysts reported in June that “whales” continue to buy up cryptocurrency.",0.051,0.889,0.059,0.6827

## Short-Term (chart [HERE] 

Bitcoin remains in a technical short-medium term bear market after trading below both the 50 and 200 Day EMAs since mid-May. Bitcoin continues to find resistance around the $35K level which is now supported by slowly declining 200 Day EMA just above.If Bitcoin gets rejected by the $35K level, we could see Bitcoin retest support at $30K or even the local lows around $29K. 

However, if you zoom out you'll see Bitcoin is still up bigly since last year and has only retraced 61.8% of this most recent macro impulsive wave higher. The only people who have lost money have bought in the last 6 months: aka retail noobs and institutions who don't understand crypto, or have a long-term investment horizon. 

Bitcoin appears to be forming a pretty clear rounded bottoming pattern starting in May and which may complete in late July/early August. With the low apparently in at just under $29K, we should look for a short-term higher high to start to form the right-side of a ""U""-shaped recovery. A confluence of resistances are consolidating in a fairly tight range between $35K - $40K. If Bitcoin can break above $40K, we could see a quick run to $50K with little resistance between there.

(July 8, 2021  8:30PM EST)

## Short-term (chart [here]

If BTC breaks below the $30K level, then it's likely that we see a $10K move based upon the consolidation pattern, making $20K the next target. If we break below $20K, then it's likely that BTC goes much lower: $10K or maybe even the 2020 low around $5K. $20K is important as it's the previous high of the 2017 bull market.

If BTC breaks above $40K, then we should see a rally to $50K as that would be a bullish divergence above the 200 and 50 Day EMAs. The order books show little selling resistance between $40K and $50K. 

All else equal, although it looks like BTC is consolidating, it's important to notice that BTC hasn't been able to recapture the 200 Day EMA yet, giving credence to the short-term downtrend on the daily chart.

07/12/21,"Wall Street giant JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. opines El Salvador’s bitcoin (BTC) adoption could be a detriment to the Bitcoin blockchain.

**Questioning the Robustness of the Bitcoin Network**

A team from JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. believes El Salvador’s embrace of bitcoin could be counter-productive for the Bitcoin blockchain.

According to the team, bitcoin trading volumes are normally within the $40-$50 billion range per day. However, most of this volume is handled by major cryptocurrency exchanges across the globe which leverage their high-performance centralized infrastructure to ensure quick BTC transactions.

Further, a considerable part of BTC is locked up in illiquid entities with over 90% of them not moving anywhere in the past year. Additionally, a “significant and rising fraction (of BTC) is held by wallets with light turnover,” the report reads.

That being said, the report adds that daily payment activity in El Salvador would represent close to 4% of recent on-chain transaction volume and over 1% of the total value of tokens that have moved between wallets in the past year. However, the illiquidity and nature of the volume is “potentially a significant limitation on its (bitcoin’s) potential as a medium of exchange,” the report concludes.

It must be recalled that in June, the El Salvadorean Congress approved President Nayib Bukele’s bid to make bitcoin a legal tender in the country.

Since the monumental development, however, there has been a divisive opinion as to the long-term viability of making BTC a legal tender.

While the current regime is leaving no stones unturned to foster bitcoin adoption among its citizens, the citizens do not appear to be big fans of the monetary experiment.

However, Bukele holds a firm conviction that bitcoin will help bank the unbanked El Salvadoreans and vastly cut the cost of sending remittances. On the contrary, the IMF is among the organizations that have questioned Bukele’s ambitious decision.

**Lightning Network to the Rescue?**

While there is skepticism regarding bitcoin’s ability to handle high transaction volume, the Lightning Network continues to scale the world’s premier cryptocurrency.

Earlier this year, BTCManager reported how US-based payment API platform Strike had inked a deal with crypto exchange Bittrex to bring the Lightning Network payments to over 200 countries.

07/13/21,"Wellbots, a major smart products e-retailer in the United States, has become the latest company to add the cryptocurrency payment option on their platforms, as the online retailer is now accepting bitcoin, ether, and other cryptocurrency assets. 

**Wellbots Enables Purchase With Crypto**

The e-retailer made the announcement in a press release on Monday (July 12, 2021). According to the platform, customers can pay for smart products with six cryptocurrencies. 

They accepted crypto assets include bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), litecoin (LTC), bitcoin cash (BCH), DAI, and USD coin (USDC). Before adding the crypto payment option, Wellbots could only purchase items using Google Pay, Amazon Pay, Credit Card, Shop Pay, Affirm, and PayPal

Meanwhile, the addition of cryptocurrencies brings the total number of payment methods to 12 on the online platform. According to the announcement, the expansion of payment options makes it easier for customers to shop on the online retailer’s website. 

Commenting on the latest development, Phil Berdugo, Wellbots’ CEO, said:

&gt;“We are excited to be among the early online retailers to let our customers pay with crypto! Wellbots has always been a pioneer, and we are delighted to constantly add innovative features and services to make our customers happy.”

The use of cryptocurrency as a payment method continues to see increased adoption, despite the volatile nature of bitcoin and other crypto-assets. With the emerging technology becoming popular, more companies are adding cryptocurrency into their payment options in order to attract more customers. 

As reported by BTCManager back in April, WeWork announced that it was accepting payment in BTC, DAI, USDC, and ETH. Convenience store chain, Sheetz, revealed in May that it would soon start accepting bitcoin and other crypto assets. Other companies that have integrated crypto as a payment means include HGreg and the Kessler Collection.

Meanwhile, the crypto payment option is also gaining ground in the e-commerce sector. Apart from Wellbots, online retail platforms like Newegg also accept crypto. The e-commerce giant eBay revealed back in May that it was mulling accepting cryptocurrency as payment.

Earlier in July, global payment giant Visa revealed that its crypto debit and credit cards processed $1 billion in transactions in the first half of 2021.

07/13/21,"Bitcoin pulled back to start the week, getting rejected by the 50 Week EMA and falling to about $32K on Tuesday. Bitcoin has been forming a bit of a sideways consolidation pattern for the past 2+ months, and based on this week's bearish start, it looks like Bitcoin's bound to resolve this sideways pattern to the *downside* in the near-term. 

(July 13, 2021  8:30PM EST)

## Short-Term (chart [here]

Bitcoin's short-term prospects look bearish as the 2-month sideways consolidation appears to be leaning towards breaking lower. This almost assuredly means Bitcoin will retest support at $30K. If there's more pain to come, then we could see a drop down to the 78.6% fib retracement of the Sept '20 - May '21 rally around $21,679 which would assuredly get bought up as it hovers just above the 2017 highs which should provide massive support. This has now become my primary view. If this happens, I still expect a massive capitulation candle that results in a violent bounce back up to $30K or higher, which should kickstart the next leg of the bull market rally. Dip-buyers will be rewarded, as they historically always have been with Bitcoin.

However, by nearly every measure, Bitcoin is still in a long-term bull market cycle. From a probability perspective, sellers are simply chasing the trade at this point; the point of least resistance over the med-long term is up, not down. For nearly all investors/traders, bull markets are when you BTFD, not fade the rally (small subset of active investors).

## BTC Dominance

Bitcoin Dominance has been pretty quiet lately, treading water around the 35-40% area as we wait for Bitcoin to resolve a sideways consolidation pattern on the weekly chart. While the triangle points lower, BTC.D may not suffer, as alts are faring worse than BTC. As a matter of fact, this may be a boon for BTC.D as more capital rotates out of alts down 60-70% and into BTC which typically leads the entire crypto market in recoveries.

## Long-Term

BTFD. Fundamentals have not changed. Daily and even weekly charts will show relatively large corrections; this is standard bull market behavior. Now that another altseason has been spectacularly squashed, this sets us up for another Bitcoin leg up to new highs.

Down 2 days, up one day, rinse, repeat. Bitcoin is slowly drifting lower back down to the $30K level again. Since July started, Bitcoin has formed a pretty clean descending pattern. As this sideways consolidation pattern comes to a close, which it could any day now, Bitcoin looks to break lower. Why? Lower highs, lower lows. A retest of support at $30K is in the cards as early as this week or possibly over the low-volume weekend trading session. Regardless, the path of least resistance in the short-term is down, not up. That's not to say this is a good time to sell Bitcoin.

All eyes are on $30K as Bitcoin looks to retest the support level and bottom of this $10K range once again. Although this time, after having traded below the 50 and 200 Day EMAs for weeks now, Bitcoin could be ready to roll over to a lower low. Whenever Bitcoin got closer to $32K, it tended to bounce quickly over the past 2 months, whereas now it's a slow grind lower. This is not encouraging for Bitcoin as it looks like buyers are afraid and shorts are heavy. Short-term, we'll likely see $20K-$29K Bitcoin. 

But that's not such a bad thing, as long-term Bitcoin is still in a macro bull market cycle.

For nearly all investors/traders, bull markets are when you BTFD, not fade the rally (small subset of active investors). I continue to add on dips, especially near major support ($30K) and lower support (78.6% fib around $21K).

07/16/21,"Square is planning to develop a new platform for decentralized finance called ”TBD.” The company’s CEO, Jack Dorsey, made the news public through a tweet.

**Non-custodial DeFi Platform**

Jack Dorsey announced the development on Thursday, July 15, on Twitter with added details. Dorsey stated that they had decided to build an open developer platform to create non-custodial permission-less and decentralized financial services.



He said that the entire development process of the platform will be open source and include roadmaps for anyone to monitor the entire process. The project is also significantly different from Square Crypto, which is independent in its activities and only receives funding from Square. 

Dorsey also added that the project will be focused on Bitcoin and stated that a dedicated Twitter and GitHub account will be created for added information. TBD will become the fourth company in the Square ecosystem that includes payment company Cash App, Music streaming platform Tidal and Seller. 

**How will Square Fare with the Competition?** 

As expected, the announcement from Jack Dorsey elicited a response from the crypto community. One user commented that the new service could replace Ethereum, while others pointed at existing blockchains that offer similar services. 

It is not known if the TBD project will be built on an existing blockchain or a native blockchain platform. However, it would face competition from existing blockchains like Ethereum, Cardano, and Binance Smart Chain that are favored by decentralized finance platforms. 

Square could decide to make the service limited to institutions and leverage the growing interest for regulated DeFi products. 

**Growing Crypto Ecosystem** 

Square has continued to expand its activities within the crypto industry since it added bitcoin services to its popular Cash App platform. As a result, it regularly purchases large volumes of bitcoin and is one of the biggest payment processing companies in the world. 

The company recently revealed that it would be developing a hardware wallet for bitcoin.

The announcement added that Square intended to build the wallet to make bitcoin custody more mainstream.  Dorsey is a big fan of bitcoin and has suggested that Square will be exploring more services in the crypto industry.  This latest development shows that the company is ready to take a major stake in the blockchain industry. [",0.005,0.911,0.084,0.9786

(June 27, 2021  8:30PM EST)

## Short-Term (chart [here]

Bitcoin is forming an ugly pattern on the chart right now as it continues to get rejected by resistance levels and looks just about ready to roll over. A break below $30K would likely send BTC to around the $20K region which is the previous cycle's ATH, where there should be ample buying pressure. This is ultimately our line in the sand; if $20K holds, we can bounce and start grinding back higher. If BTC breaks lower than $20K, then it will have retraced nearly the entire bull market rally thus far and we may be in a market purgatory for months if not a couple years. I lean much heavier towards the former scenario.

If we test $20K, I expect the buyers to step in and BTFD, especially institutional investors who have been waiting for more of a value entry position. Remember, it takes months (if not longer) for institutions to get compliance and finance approval to take new (and large) positions, especially into a new asset class. Saylor's friends and acquaintances could very well step in here and buy up a ton of BTC on the cheap: we already know retail has been and will continue to do so. If and I think it's more of a matter of when $30K breaks, I expect a violent bearish candle to $20K that results in an abrupt bounce back up to $30K or higher which should kickstart the next leg of the bull market rally.

There's simply too much bullishness in the space for BTC to prematurely enter another bear market. Demand is higher than ever--and growing. Supply is low--and decreasing. There are more and new ways for new investors and users to buy Bitcoin and crypto than ever before--and growing. Simply put, the fundamentals are extremely bullish and becoming ever-more bullish. While short-term price action is volatile, over the medium-long-term, this should be reflected in the price. I, as well as many others still very much expect BTC price to be well above $65K no later than Q4 2021.

In the pilot version of spot trading, the exchange now supports BTC/USDT, ETH/USDT, XRP/USDT and EOS/USDT trading pairs while more to ""follow shortly.""

The full version of spot trading will arrive before September, Zhou told Cryptonews.com.

Also, along with this, ByBit plans to introduce Wallet 2.0 for instant withdrawals, aiming to remove limits commonly associated with cold wallets, per the CEO.

Additionally, the company aims to launch options trading in the last quarter of 2021.

Other upcoming changes to the platform include upgrading the mobile app and desktop versions, supporting more local languages and fiat currencies.

They’ve also opened their ByFi Center for users to explore different mining contracts, noting that “cloud mining is no longer exclusive to the big leagues.”

Another major project for the company is BitDAO. In June, decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) BitDAO raised USD 230m, with ByBit pledging 2.5 basis points of their futures contracts trading volume to the BitDAO treasury.

“In all honesty, BitDAO is bigger than us,” said Zhou. “Dozens of institutions and DeFi projects have a stake. In a sense, BitDAO’s success will be entirely its own because its future will be decided by its community.”

According to the CEO, what we’re seeing now is new decentralized organizations competing on their ability to actualize the governance power by token owners - and the quality of the technology makes a difference.

Meanwhile, when it comes to decentralized exchanges, Bybit itself will “eventually” also follow the decentralized path, delivering their ""centralized products in a more decentralized way,"" said Zhou.

Regulatory triangle

With regulations tightening around the industry across the world, ByBit was not spared either. In June, it got a warning from Japan's Financial Services Agency (FSA), stating that exchanges based outside Japan must not target Japanese residents with advertising campaigns without obtaining prior operating permission.

Per Similarweb data, in June, Japan was the second-largest market in terms of visits to Bybit.com (7%), however, the number of visits dropped by 21%, compared to May. Most visits were from South Korea (up by 26% in a month). Trading on this platform is not available to US investors.

Crypto Derivatives Giant Bybit Enters Spot Trading With More Products In Pipeline 

In either case, when it comes to regulation, decentralization, privacy and anti-money laundering (AML) compliance is not “an impossible triangle,” but there are a lot of misconceptions, according to the CEO. Therefore, regulatory clarity will benefit all stakeholders.

“Overall, we expect public demands for more decentralization and democratization - and rules will eventually have to catch up with that,” the CEO argued, adding that “I do fancy though new technologies and ideas we haven’t seen today might be the answer, not incumbent rules.”

Per Zhou, “2020 was the year the power of retail investors manifested in the democratization of finance.” The realization of the power that retail investors have as a collective led to a number of “dramatic episodes” in the equity markets, such as GameStop.

“In many ways these events, both in the crypto and traditional financial markets, were revolutionary and challenged institutional investors to rethink their roles and strategies. It reflects a shift in mentality and the will of the masses to become responsible for their own prosperity,” Zhou said.

It is “most probably” a challenge to established institutions, and it does put retail investors at risk, and yet there is no definitive answer or a single solution when it comes to the regulatory responses, or even the question if they address the real issues in the first place.

But “the trend is irreversible,” said Zhao, “that retail investors, many young and less experienced, will demand better access and more transparency in any market they choose to participate in. And that’s what exchanges should compete on.”

07/21/21,"Bulls have successfully managed to defend the BTC price against further losses below $29K. The largest cryptocurrency gained momentum on Wednesday and reclaimed the long-standing $30K support. The BTC/USD pair has gained a respectable 7% in the last 24 hours, hitting a high of $30,798 before correcting gains.

**Rebound Sparks Massive Liquidations**

The bounce from yesterday’s brutal sell-off saw numerous bottom shorters liquidated, as shown by data from ByBit. Tailwind from the BTC rebound also saw other cryptocurrencies such as ETH and XRP log significant recoveries.

Bitcoin’s return to form comes as network fundamentals continue to improve. The hash rate is now nearing 100 EH/s, edging closer to its record highs of 168 EH/s seen before China’s crackdown on miners. Meanwhile, the network difficulty is well on track to increase despite the recent price retracement.

These strong fundamentals delighted MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor, who wrote that the Bitcoin Network has never been in better shape.

**Genuine Comeback or Dead Cat Bounce?**

Despite bitcoin reclaiming critical support, some analysts express fears that the bounce is a short-lived  “relief rally” and not a proper comeback after a price bottom.

Popular podcast host Nebraskan Gooner told his Twitter followers that the “short the bounce” season is still on. Similarly, Vijay Ayyar, head of Singapore-based cryptocurrency exchange Luno, predicted the BTC price could continue to slide..

07/21/21,"I am restless so I would like to take a moment to share my current ""bear market"" crypto investment strategy with you all. I will list target coins, detail intro strategy, DCA/purchasing strategy, staking/rewards, exchange/wallet options, and more. I feel like this would have been helpful to hear when I was first starting out, even if it is not perfect. I am not here to shill my coins so I won't go into details there. I understand others may have different positions - I would love to hear what you are all doing to maximize this current stage in the market. This is not financial advice...

Target Coins

* BTC 30%
* ETH 30%
* ADA 5%
* ALGO 5%
* ATOM 5%
* XTZ 5%
* DOT 5%
* VET 5%
* LTC 5%
* DASH 5%
* BAT
* XLM

Intro strategy

I have had a small bag all coins listed and a few more before the recent ATH correction. The first thing I did was to sell out of projects that I was not truly behind, and everything I did not truly understand/see a use case for. When I saw prices that were decent (one of the first dips to 29/30k) I took the extra cash and then some to re-invest in the above list. This gives me a lower/good cost average for my coins moving forward.

Exchange info

I use Binance US only for VET. I have only used them for about a year, so I don't have as much trust with this exchange, but have had no bad experiences. Moderate fees, funds hold 10 days before withdraw from ACH deposit, allows access to shitcoins (LOL). I use Uphold for the sole purpose of BAT. It is the wallet accepted by the Brave Brower, which rewards free BAT monthly for receiving ads. I would change this immediately if I could, not a fan. I have used Coinbase and Coinbase Pro since 2017, and this is where I buy most crypto. I feel its important to explain why I use CB, because it has been very helpful in the process.

* Trust (Old exchange, SEC regulated stock)
* Earn (I have earned over $50 worth of crypto for free)
* Instant transfer deposits (from ACH, to Coinbase - not CB Pro. Allows immediate transfer of funds)
* Low/no cost conversions (Coinbase allows converting from crypto to crypto. I have never noticed a loss in dollar value after a conversion. Converting to stable coins does not apply, as there is a trading fee)
* CB Card (I deposit spending money in USDC, spend and earn 4% back in XLM)
* In house staking (Initially I used this more, but I chose to move all but ETH to wallets)
* App layout, crypto markets/information (between CB and CB Pro there are many ways to analyze charts, markets, and research coins.)
* Instant transfer between CB/CB Pro
* CB Pro ordering functions (lower market order fees starting at .5%, decreasing as volume increases monthly. Limit orders are even less. Access to limit buys and sells is important)

Investing strategy

I earn income weekly, so I have an amount set aside that I set up a recurring deposit to Coinbase (USDC). There is no fee, and I actually earned $5 for setting it up. 100% of this is transferred to CB Pro, instantly, for free. It is then converted to USD, where 50% is placed in market orders, as split in the coin breakdown above.

The other 50% is placed on limit orders. I take a look at the charts and find the 14-28 day low average for each coin, and this is my starting point for the first order. The second order will be placed at a percentage loss from that starting point, and the third will be placed at a percentage loss from the second order. I chose -15% for BTC and ETH, and -20% for all others listed. Example - BTC starting point/1st limit order $30500. 2nd limit order is -15% so $25925. 3rd limit order is -15% again so 22036. If the limit orders don't trigger, I simply add more to the order the next DCA, strengthening my purchasing power for the correction. If the orders trigger, the process starts again with the next deposit.

BAT and XLM are earned through Brave browser and CB Card, respectively. I do take seperate funds and deposit USDC for the sole purpose of having USDC to spend and earn XLM on my daily purchases and bills. I leave the BAT in Uphold due to fees but transfer the XLM to Celsius to gain interest. As you will see, the next part of the ""investing"" is actually earning crypto by staking/holding.

Wallet info

I am getting tired so I'll speed it up. Although most vets would recommend them, I have yet to purchase a hardware wallet. I feel secure with my amount of crypto with my wallets and exchanges security. 2FA, passphrases, whitelisting, etc. have given me security for years. I'll just list what I use and why.

* Celsius (BTC/DASH/XLM) - not my own ""wallet"" technically but has layers of security. The risk is in the company, whom I try to keep tabs on. you receive 6.2% APY on BTC, 4.6% on DASH and 3.1% on XLM. Free withdraws. DASH and BTC have relatively low transfer fees so not much is lost on the way in. XLM has 0 fees!
* Blockfi (LTC) - See Celsius description but 4.5% on LTC, with low transfer in and 1 free withdraw a month. Admittedly I am less favorable of their operations.
* Coinbase (ETH) - It has high costs to transfer ETH and its tokens, so I choose not to. I lock in the ETH on CB for 5% APY.
* Yoroi &amp; Daedalus (ADA) - Native wallets for ADA. I split my ADA in these two wallets with different staking pools. Easy to operate after researching.
* ALGO Wallet (ALGO) - Native wallet of ALGO. Smooth interface, easy to operate with automatic staking.
* Cosmostation (ATOM) - Native wallet of ATOM. Smooth interface, easy to operate with automatic staking.
* Magma (XTZ) - Native wallet of XTZ. Smooth, easy to operate after researching.
* PolkaWallet (DOT) - Native wallet of DOT. Smooth, easy to operate after researching.
* VeChainThor (VET) - Native wallet of VET. Smooth interface, easy to operate with automatic staking. (Earns VTHO)

07/21/21,"Bitcoin rallied on Wednesday, recovering back above the $30K level and nearly reaching $33K before pulling back a bit, closing the daily around $32K. This is bullish short-term as it validated support at $30K, erased the previous 2 days' losses, and gives us a short-term higher high. A drop below $30K is definitely still possible, but it's encouraging to see Bitcoin successfully retest support at $30K.

(July 15, 2021  8:30PM EST)

## Short-Term (chart [here]

While yesterday it seemed like Bitcoin was on the verge of breaking down to a new lower low, Bitcoin rallied today on the back of the much-anticipated Elon Musk/Jack Dorsey/Cathy Woods Bitcoin conference. The conference's hype surrounding Elon Musk's generally bullish comments and positions regarding Bitcoin boded well for Bitcoin's price, which rallied as much as 9% on the day. We're far from out of the woods, but $30K seems like strong support and a good medium-long term level to add to positions. 

If BTC breaks below $30K with an impulsive candle, then we'll probably see a swift drop to the low $20Ks where we should see a flurry of buyers step in to BTFD. If BTC breaks above the 50 Day EMA around $37K right now, this would be extremely bullish and give us a bullish divergence. With rapidly declining EMAs, that's much more within reach now—roughly a $5K jump from here. A break above $40K would be even more bullish and almost certainly send BTC to near $50K as there's not much resistance in between. While Bitcoin's short-term range has tightened considerably, it should still be viewed in the light of $10K ranges now. 

From a probability perspective, sellers are simply chasing the trade at this point; the point of least resistance over the med-long term is up, not down. For nearly all investors/traders, bull markets are when you BTFD, not fade the rally (small subset of active investors). I continue to add on dips, especially near major support ($30K) and lower support (78.6% fib around $21K). Given all the bullish fundamentals and technicals developing and coming to light on a weekly basis in crypto and Bitcoin, there is no reason to believe we're about to enter a multi-year bear market. As a matter of fact, if you were wishing for cheap Bitcoin to get in when it was at $65K, now's your chance. 

## Long-Term

BTFD. Fundamentals have not changed. Daily and even weekly charts will show relatively large corrections; this is standard bull market behavior. Now that another altseason has been spectacularly squashed, this sets us up for another Bitcoin leg up to new highs. By nearly every measure, we are nowhere near a top; in fact, we are *maybe* halfway through this bull market. What do you do during bull markets? [Buy. The. Dip.]

## Support: $30K, then 78.6% fib retracement around $21,679.  

## Resistance: $35K, EMAs around $36.9K, then $40K. ",0.042,0.83,0.128,0.9923

But there’s still speculation some traders might try to use the moment to push prices as high as $50,000 to increase their payoff or minimize any payouts.

The May expiry, expected early Friday, would have been much bigger had it not been for bitcoin’s recent drop from $58,000 to $30,000, which pricked the speculative bubble in the market. That makes the upcoming last week of July expiry the smallest of 2021 in terms of nominal value. The question is will it go much lower again this end of the month?

**Crypto Markets Surge Ahead of Amazon Rumours**

Amazon, the world’s largest e-commerce company is reportedly working toward accepting payments in bitcoin (BTC) as early as ‘by the end of the year’ a report by *City A.M.* claims.

In addition to integrating crypto payments, Amazon is reportedly also looking to launch its own digital currencies. More details about the same are yet to be disclosed, an insider told the publication.

For the uninitiated, last week Amazon published several job openings out of which a few were of particular interest as they related to the company looking for a cryptocurrency and blockchain lead.

According to the job description, the ideal candidate for the position would be someone who can “leverage domain expertise in blockchain, distributed ledger, central bank digital currencies and cryptocurrencies.”

Further, the job description adds that it wants to “develop the case for the capabilities which should be developed, drive the overall vision and product strategy, and gain leadership buy-in and investment for new capabilities.”

Per sources close to the matter, the directive to embrace crypto payments has come directly from Jeff Bezos himself. The source told the publication:

&gt;“This isn’t just going through the motions to set up cryptocurrency payment solutions at some point in the future – this is a full-on, well-discussed, integral part of the future mechanism of how Amazon will work.”

Adding:

&gt;“It begins with Bitcoin – this is the key first stage of this crypto project, and the directive is coming from the very top… Jeff Bezos himself.”

The source went on to say that once bitcoin (BTC) payments are integrated, the company will move forward to integrate other large-cap cryptocurrencies such as ether, cardano, and bitcoin cash, among others.

**Crypto Market Reacts to Amazon Speculation**

With the Amazon rumor running rife, the wider crypto markets posted strong gains, leading the total market cap over $1.55 trillion at the time of writing.

Pretty much all top cryptocurrencies by market cap, such as bitcoin, ether, XRP, cardano, and dogecoin are in the green at press time.

In related news, BTCManager reported that Tesla could soon resume accepting payments in bitcoin (BTC) after its CEO, Elon Musk is convinced the majority of mining for BTC is powered by renewable energy.

07/27/21,"William Cai, co-founder of the New York-based investment firm Wilshire Phoenix said that investors in the United States may have to wait till 2023 before regulators approve a Bitcoin ETF. 

**US Might not get Bitcoin ETF in 2021**

According to *Business Insider* on Sunday (July 25, 2021), Cai said that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is not planning to approve a Bitcoin ETF in 2021. The Wilshire Phoenix executive said that the United States may get its first BTC ETF either in 2022 or 2023. 

Cai noted that despite the growing demand for bitcoin and other crypto assets, the SEC is yet to approve an application. The Wilshire Phoenix co-founder also mentioned reasons for the delay, stating that one of the major concerns for the SEC was market manipulation. In addition, the US regulator still felt that cryptocurrency was not a fully-matured asset class, as they were relatively new. 

Cai’s statements stem from previous experience with the US securities regulators. Wilshire Phoenix saw its Bitcoin ETF proposal delayed by the SEC back in 2019 before the regulatory watchdog rejected the company’s application in February 2020. 

Meanwhile, Cai stated that there has been no change between the Jay Clayton’s and Gary Gensler’s administrations. For the Wilshire Phoenix executive, the sentiment expressed towards Bitcoin ETFs we’re still the same.

According to Cai:

&gt;“I’ve seen nothing that suggests there’s been a switch in their thinking. Once it became more clear that Gensler was going to be \[SEC chairman\], to us it was even more of the case that \[a bitcoin ETF approval\] wasn’t going to happen.”

## Bitcoin ETF not a Priority for the SEC

Presently, there are over eight Bitcoin ETF applications before the SEC. Earlier in July, Global X became the latest company to file for a BTC ETF. Other applicants include VanEck, which was one of the first companies to introduce a Bitcoin ETF, along with Galaxy Digital, SkyBridge Capital, among others.

However, Cai stated that approving a Bitcoin ETF was not top of the list for SEC Commissioner Gary Gensler. The Wilshire Phoenix co-founder said that Gensler was focused on regulating Robinhood, meme stocks, and ensuring environmental, social, and governance (ESG) compliance. 

However, Cai is optimistic that the United States will get a Bitcoin ETF, adding that it would benefit the market. [",0.043,0.886,0.072,0.892

So, right, now, we are seeing a very good ascending trend on the charts. 

Here's the screenshot: 

[

What do I see here: 

1. We had four touches about the trendline that I plotted. Naturally, the first touch was ""formational"" and the three other ones were very clean. I like BTC for this cleanliness which is not to be found at my other fav - EUR/USD - which is why it's not my fav nomore. 
2. I am trading margin x100 and I am always allocating the risk exposure of no more than 1,5% of my overall deposit, so you know... And I saw 3 good opportunities to enter the trades. And you know where they were - at the bounces from the trendline I plotted :) 

I didn't enter those deals though because I am just starting with this (I am a contentwriter in crypto as my official job) but I think that I would have made good profits, should I have entered in any of them. 

3. SLs in those deals would have been at the trendline, the entries would be around 100$ higher than the trendline and the TP would be broken down into two portions: 1SL for the 50% and 2SL for the 50% with the manual move of SL to BE upon 1SL.

4. Comment about ""good videos"" on youtube. I am seeing that there are no good written TA analysis of this kind online. 

And I am seeing that the ""good videos"" don't touch upon the super-scalping details like this and they go immediately into very complicated mechanics and indicators. I understand that it makes sense that trading should be hard because if it weren't hard, anybody and everybody would be making money here. 

However, I also posit that there are some significant external obstacles that prevent folks from trading - the main job, lack of trust. Thus, it's not about the use of the indicators, but more about those externalities. 

I posit that all of those indicators are complete crappy crap, and that the super-local analysis that I am doing is not crap. Why? Because of this - [ 

If you had entered based on my super-duper trend-line-based strategy here, you would have exited the deal at TP2 already. And though you might say that there would be so many deals where you I would SL, to this I would respond - let's see. 

My point is that markets are super-fleeting, and I think that it makes sense to just open and exit the deals slowly growing your capital.

07/29/21,"Hi there,

for about 2 months I am using grind trading on Binance and Kucoin. On Kucoin I use a very wide range without leverage for the long term, on Binance I create rather narrow grids for the short term when I expect a time of sideways action, especially after strong price action. For these short-term Grids, I use ""high"" leverage, usually an x10.

Now I was wondering what would happen in case of leveraging a wide grid for the long term (let's say BTC Grid range 22000 - 100.000, 149 steps, x10 leverage). How high would be the risk of liquidation in a grid with x10 leverage? I was playing around in excel and I am normally mathematical experienced but couldn't figure out how the risk of liquidation changes while running a grid. Is there a risk of liquidation at all due to the constant averaging down in the grid? And if there is a risk of liquidation, how could I calculate the amount of margin to avoid liquidation of my x10 futures?

Would be happy to get some ideas from you. Or maybe someone already has experience in this approach.",0.068,0.867,0.065,-0.1408

Hey guys, it's us again (posted before on /r/cryptomarkets) with MyBlackSwan. The app has been updated to include more data with the algorithm (4 years) and more functionality for ease of use. The app is simple: it displays 3 graphs, first today's trends by search volume over the past 30 days, second yesterday's, and third the change between yesterday and today. Research shows that a positive change is a buy signal and a negative change is a sell signal. The latest supreme buys have seen rises of up to 50% days after their appearance on the swan. 

Keep in mind, this data doesn't exist in a vacuum (meaning there's more to buying cryptos than google trends), so don't take this as investment advice and invest at your own risk.

08/02/21,"Global oil giant Saudi Aramco has denied reports stating that the company intends to mine bitcoin in the foreseeable future.  

**Initial Claims of Bitcoin Mining Activity** 

Reports had surfaced in recent days that Aramco intended to launch bitcoin mining operations. Brazilian bitcoin miner Ray Nasser had posted on YouTube that his company was negotiating with Aramco to utilize excess energy produced by the Oil company to mine BTC. 

&gt;“We are negotiating with Aramco. All black liquid \[oil\] that comes out of the desert belongs to this company. All the flared gas they’re not using, and that’s public information, I can tell you, it’s enough to ‘power up’ half of the bitcoin network today, from this company alone,” he stated. 

Aramco swiftly denied these claims in a statement issued on Monday.

&gt;“With reference to recent reports claiming that the company will embark on bitcoin mining activities, Aramco confirms that these claims are completely false and inaccurate.”

Bitcoin mining requires a large amount of energy which Aramco has readily supply. The company produces a significant chunk of the world’s oil supply and can channel energy from the gas flaring process towards bitcoin mining with minimal operating costs. 

Some oil companies have looked to leverage this opportunity by using excess gas power to mine bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. For example, an American mining company was reported to have shipped portable bitcoin mining equipment to oil and gas firms for mining activities. 

**Aramco and Blockchain Technology**

Aramco is no stranger to blockchain technology and currently deploys DLT within its system. It uses the technology within its supply management operation to standardize business processes and increase efficiency while reducing costs. 

In addition, the oil giant has invested in two blockchain projects: Data Gumbo and VAKT that aims to develop management and automation of new contracts and invoices. This investment shows the company’s commitment to taking a foothold in the fast-growing blockchain industry. 

However, launching a bitcoin mining operation could be tricky giving the recent commitments of the Saudi oil company. Aramco revealed in 2019 that it was committed to achieving a zero net gas flaring operation by 2030.  Bitcoin mining has its controversies with energy consumption and it remains to be seen if the oil giant would be willing to reconsider its current stance in the future.

Good morning  everyone! I have the daily for BTC pulled up today and it seems the  bulls rallied as we were approaching outer space. Right now we are  fighting the 100 EMA on the daily. It is now resistance. I drew the 4hr  100 EMA below the candles as well to show you all that there is some  support. I consider it weak and there isnt much between us and that  daily 50 MA below.   


The good thing about  the 50 MA is it is seemingly lined up with that bottom border of the  cloud. Double support always garners more confidence. But don't get  cocky. We still have a gap between 32500 and 34500 below. I forgot to  mention we did establish a higher high. It may not amount to much but  it's worth mentioning.   


ETH EIP 1559 was  delayed til tomorrow, not because the people at ETH are incompetent.  Rather the update is set to launch at a certain block and it will be  reached on the 5th. ETH and all alts are tied to BTC. If there is a big  drop the alts follow. Well if ETH drops will BTC fall? I remember events  like this in the past and they build up to the event and a percentage  of investors sell. Not everyone. But the ones that wanted to get in on  the possible pump. I cant guarantee anything but from my experiences I  say set a stop loss and alerts. The drop may be too fast to trip that  stop.

We are still above the cloud (BTC and  ETH) so its still sunny out. This market is unpredictable and one should  use all the risk management at your disposal in order to avert the  volatility and the risk that accompanies it. Proceed with caution. The  bears are like the orcs on LOTR. They may not be as smart as the bulls,  but there are many of them. WTFDIK???

08/05/21,"JPMorgan has reportedly joined forces with NYDIG to roll out a new private bitcoin (BTC) fund. Sources close to the bank have hinted that the fund, which is only available to clients of JPMorgan’s Private Bank, currently has no investors but the firm is seriously pitching the bitcoin investment vehicle to prospective investors, according to reports on August 5, 2021.

**JPMorgan Delving Deeper into Bitcoin**

After several months in the works, Jamie Dimon’s JPMorgan, one of the largest financial institutions in the world, has finally launched its bitcoin (BTC) fund in a landmark move that shows the cryptocurrency ecosystem is gradually coming of age.

Per sources close to the matter, the passively managed bitcoin fund was developed in collaboration with New York Digital Investment Group (NYDIG) and the team has made it clear that it will be available to only a select group of its wealthy clients.

Notably, JPMorgan has described its new bitcoin investment offering as the safest and cheapest fund available on the private markets. The firm has also hinted that the fund may be converted to an exchange-traded fund (ETF) when the Securities and Exchange Commission finally starts greenlighting them.

**Bitcoin’s Legitimacy Rising Steadily**

JPMorgan’s complete transformation from being a totally bitcoin-averse financial institution to one that has now embraced the super volatile cryptocurrency with open arms goes a long way to show that the long-time rhetoric held by critics that bitcoin is just a tool for fraudsters, has lost its authenticity.

Even JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon in September 2017, described bitcoin (BTC) as a ‘fraud” destined to blow up, adding that “the currency isn’t going to work. “You can’t have a business where people can invent a currency out of thin air and think that people who are buying it are really smart. I would fire any of my workers trading bitcoin in a second, for two reasons: it is against our rules and they are stupid, and both are dangerous,” Dimon said at the time.

More recently, in March 2021, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen [argued] that bitcoin poses immense danger to both the public and investors.

&gt;“I don’t think that bitcoin …is widely used as a transaction mechanism. To the extent, it is used I fear it’s often for illicit finance. It’s an extremely inefficient way of conducting transactions, and the amount of energy that’s consumed in processing those transactions is staggering,” he said 

With global institutional interest in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies steadily increasing, it is expected that the legitimacy of these innovative digital assets will continue to move in an upward trajectory.

At press time, the price of bitcoin ([BTC] is sitting around $38,151, with a market cap of $715.24 billion, according to CoinMarketCap.

08/08/21,"The pi cycle top indicator predicts tops when the 111DMA cross with the 350DMAx2

So far it has been 100% accurate



We're going to use this formula to compare it's final 111 days with the 239 (350-111) days preceding it

**b=239a+111b/175**

**b=3.734a**

''b'' is the average price of it's final 111 days before the top

''a'' is the average price of the 239 days preceding those 111 days

**So for the pi cycle indicator to cross, the average price of the final 111 days need to be 3.734x greater than the 239 days preceding it**



Example scenario 1:

If bitcoin happens to top 111 days from today, using the 239 DMA which is 42k,

42x3.734=156.828....So, the next 111 days would need to average 157k



Example scenario 2:

If bitcoin were to top at the end of April 2022 at 200k, bitcoin would need to average approx 42k for 2021



Conclusion:

For bitcoin to be confluent with most other top indicators (roughly 200k). Bitcoin needs to average approx 40-45k for the 239 days.

If bitcoin were to reach 200k next year, it may appear strange but bitcoin looks like it might become ahead of schedule

Bitcoin averaging 40-45k for 239 days looks unlikely unless the pi cycle top ends up much higher than 200k

If bitcoin has a strong 239 days, then it will have an insanely strong final 111 days. This may sound like good news for some, but a lot of things don't add up. I personally can't picture Bitcoin reaching a 4T+ market cap next year

It's possible the pi cycle indicator cannot work with lengthening cycle theory because it assumes a strong final 111 days and a weak 239 days",0.023,0.852,0.125,0.9792

Good morning  everyone! Bitcoin is looking solid this morning and the bulls are awake  early. All good signs for the start of the week. First things first. We  are currently above the daily 200 MA which is significant. If we can  hold onto these current gains we have a real shot at leaving that 200 MA  below us. That would make me full bull... But we really need to close  the daily candle above the former resistance for this pump to be  worthwhile.   


If we lose and close below  that daily 200 MA it does not mean we are heading for 0. LOL. It just  means that we failed in this attempt. I must confess failing to break  that 200 MA would be considered bearish by the bulls but as we saw  already over the past few days... The bulls are persistent and they  don't give up as easily as people think. The 200 MA is a major indicator  and bots along with traders pay attention to MA's (MA= moving average) ,  especially the daily 200 MA.

I'm still  bullish and until we see a solid rejection off the daily 200 MA I remain  optimistic. That doesnt mean I am abandoning a stop loss! The gap from  this past weekend filled almost immediately this morning. I hope these  gaps become more reliable because I used to trade them often. Great way  to start the week with a win...

Well we managed to  hang onto the newly found support of the 200 MA and things are still  looking bullish overall for crypto. We crept into the 46k range this  morning and I expect that the western hemisphere will wake up to a  collective sigh of relief. But there is still work to be done! I took  some time this morning to look into possible future resistance. And I  can see around 50k we see many instances of support and resistance so  that is the real next hurdle IMO. But we still have some ground to cover  in order to climb to 50k..

RSI suggests a  possible pull back but with the recent developments (breaking of the 200  MA) the RSI may take a backseat to fomo buyers. As bullish as any of us  may be we still need to remember risk management is key to ensuring  your gains stay gains. As long as we remain above the 200 MA we are in  decent shape and it may take some time but RSI will catch up if we can  maintain these gains. The entire premise of the bull run not being over  begins with holding onto the recently gained 200 MA. IMO this is the  line in the sand. If it holds we are bullish. If we lose the 200 MA it's  not so bullish.   


ETH looks great and from a  technical standpoint ETH is more bullish than even BTC. But if a big  move up or down happens for either coin they will follow each other. The  ETH market cap is 40% of Bitcoin. That is significant. So yes I do  believe ETH can lead the pack. At this point if you ignore ETH you are  lying to yourself.

Well the bulls did a U-turn and we retook the 200 MA overnight.  Well done bulls. Losing that 200 MA was a bearish event but retaking it  shows the market is resilient. Even at these current levels. What needs  to happen with this current candle is it needs to close above $45,220.  That is the current price I have my eyes on. That 200 MA is not going to  give up quietly and we really need to separate ourselves from the  support with a good green candle.

Bitcoin looks  great if you are a bull but I still recommend setting a stop loss.  People always ask me where I set my stop loss. Well I have made a video  explaining how I go about setting a stop. And that is typically just  below the strongest support around me.. It's not rocket science but it  does take some trial and error before you see results you desire...

Support held throughout the lower volume weekend.  But can it continue?

We are approaching a sort  of ""squeeze point"" which in essence is a place on the chart where the  candles become locked in (in this instance between ascending support and  the resistance at 48k). We have 2 factors I want to bring up. First of  all, RSI is very high. We should all know by now what that means  (bearish) but we also understand that the RSI is not very reliable on  its own. We also have the ascending right triangle pattern we are in  currently and from past experience these patterns are typically  considered bullish. But with RSI the way it is I highly recommend a stop  loss!

We have had 4 solid weekly closes. Each  candle was around a 6k gain give or take. The bulls seem intent on  taking us to the resistance around 50k but we need volume to get there.  Perhaps the bears strike? Don't lose hope. This is like a dance.  Sometimes the bulls lead. Sometimes the bears lead. If you can navigate  these changes you can make some decent profit bear or bull. The evidence  is right there on the charts folks! Have a great day WTFDIK???

The second option is susceptible to the swings of the market while the option has yet to expire. The trade may execute but at the time of option expiry be below the 50k.

08/22/21,"Bitcoin continues to surge as the bulls eye $50,000 figure as the next major resistance. 

**Bitcoin Close to Smashing Through $50,000**

Premier cryptocurrency bitcoin has been on a steady rise for the past few weeks and if the momentum is anything to go by, it won’t be long before the $50k resistance is smashed for good.

The surge in price has also been supported by several bullish technical indicators such as the recent “golden cross” pattern where a short-term moving average goes above the long-term moving average.

In addition to the aforementioned, the orange coin has displayed a strong recovery including its movement past its 200-day moving average earlier this month hinting that the psychological resistance of $50,000 might be in cards for the bulls to conquer soon.

Further, the total market cap of bitcoin has also risen above $900 billion and looks to capture the $1 trillion market cap once again.

**Institutional Adoption on the Rise**

The rise in bitcoin’s price can be attributed to the rapid pace of institutional adoption of the largest cryptocurrency by market cap.

Of late, a number of institutional investors have been warming up to bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and a reliable store of value to tackle any ‘black swan’ events.

A trend started by business intelligence firm MicroStrategy, a greater number of corporations are following suit to add crypto assets to their balance sheet to diversify their asset holdings.

As the close followers of the industry might remember, Elon Musk’s Tesla announced earlier this year that the company had bought BTC worth a whopping $1.5 billion and that the company would also allow customers to pay for Tesla models with bitcoin.

However, soon enough the company discontinued the service citing bitcoin’s energy-intensive mining. Fortunately enough, however, at the recently concluded ‘The B-Word’ conference, Musk said that Tesla would ‘most likely’ resume the bitcoin payments service soon.

Similarly, Wall Street giants have also been vying to add bitcoin to their list of offerings on the back of the rising demand from accredited investors and private clients.

As recently reported by BTCManager, Wells Fargo had filed for a passive bitcoin fund with the U.S. SEC.

I’ve been looking for a bot that will allow me to do special things. I never thought that I would have to call my strategy “special”, but since it has proven so difficult to find a bot to do this, well, I think it fits.

I actually want to do two things.

1)     I want to create a portfolio of about 20 coins in Kraken. I know there are bots that can do this, but I have not found a bot that would allow me to buy “x” amount of dollars’ worth of those 20 coins (distributed according to the pre-determined proportions). I would like to do this every “y” time.

For example, I would like a bot that would allow me to create a portfolio of the top 20 coins (by market cap) in Kraken, the amount of each coin will be proportional to the market cap of each coin, and I would like the bot to buy $1,000 in such proportion every 1 week. All automated.

 

2)     I would like a bot that will buy “x” dollars of a single coin every “y” time, and I would like for “y” to range from 10 minutes to a few days. 

For example, buy $1 worth of Cardano every 10 minutes. (minimum limits by Kraken might make this impossible, this is just an example).

Good day! I have the 4hr pulled up today for BTC and we can see  that we are clearly in consolidation at this point. That can be a good  thing or a bad thing depending on your positions. As we approach the end  of the triangle I drew I expect a move to occur. This could be just a  breather before the bulls recommence the rocket ride north. If the bears  win this triangle we can revisit 44k. 44k looks to be support. Albeit  minor support.   


The 200 MA lies below us at  around 45k. This is only the 4hr 200 MA so it is not quite as solid as  the daily 200 MA. But I still appreciate the reliability of the 200 MA.  Even on the 4hr time frame. The daily 200 MA is sitting just above the  4hr 200 MA at around 46k. So support is quite abundant and as a result  the bulls may pull another bull candle on us... No guarantees though so  set that stop loss traders.  


I pointed out  the 100 EMA. Many people ask me why I mix Moving averages (MA's) and  Exponential moving averages (EMA's) and all I can really claim is  through rigorous time and effort reading charts on the regular I saw a  lot of reason to keep the 100 EMA in my repertoire. We can see it  clearly is support on the 4hr time frame anyways. One thing I noticed is  every time we test the 100 EMA we seem to go a bit more south in  relation to where the 100 EMA lies. With each test we drop just a bit  more. Just keep an eye on the 4hr 100 EMA as if we lose it I believe we  may just drop to approximately 44k...

Right now  my best advice to play this pattern is to do what I do. Go long and set  a good stop loss. If we break up I get profit. If not my stop will trip  and I may lose a bit but I plan to make up for that on the bounce. Have  a great Tuesday and always remember WTFDIK??

09/01/21,"Bitcoin has started off the new month of September, with new lows not seen over the week. BTC formed a peak of about $48,245, and the price began to fall. It shattered the support levels of $47,500 and $47,000. 

**Coinbase BTC Outflow**

Data fom TBEN Markets Pro and TradingView shows that BTC/USD has hit lows of  $46,530on Bitstamp in one day. It is the lowest the coin has experienced since August 27.

It traded around the support area of $46,500 and formed a low area of about $46,540.  It is now consolidating the losses near the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decrease from the $48,245 swing high to $46,540. Bitcoin is currently gaining again and trading at $47,686.71.

For Willy Woo, an analyst, who echoed this week’s findings, Bitcoin is likely to maintain a large pool of support in the current ranges.  BTC has a pricing base ranging from $45,000 to $50,000 for over 1.65 million of them.

He said on Twitter that Bitcoin is approaching a price stability region. The zone around $51,000 is set to crumble at the mid-level. It is a final obstacle level to Bitcoin. The timing for this is quite a mystery.

**Investors See the Light**

In turn, investors seemed to go on the day with reserves on Coinbase recording the [lowest] since December 2017. There are only 700,000 BTC and about $20 billion in stablecoins in centralized trading platforms ready for exchange. During the May sell-off, there was quite some BTC inflow. Coinbase is currently experiencing a large outflow of coins, according to Glassnode.

Cointelegraph contributor Michael van de Poppe however, sees nothing much in the news. He insists that it is just business as usual for BTC as it goes through consolidation.

**Ethereum is Rallying**

Ethereum formed a base for a sustained gain at $3,250 and began. The price of the ETH cleared the resistance levels of $3,350 and $3,380.

It even rose above the $3,400 zone and was significantly above the 100-hour average. Nearly $3,477 was established before a downside reversal took place. The price was lower than 3,400 dollars, but the bulls were active at around $3,350.

Overnight ETH/USD exceeded $ 3,500, the highest over the US Dollar and the BTC in three months. Its cryptocurrency market cap dominance climbed to 20.4 percent, with bitcoin holding steady at 44 percent.

Successful bulls could lead to larger gains than $3,480. The next biggest resistance is close to $3,500. Once crossed, it may lead to another break above the $3,500 resistance. Ether may rise to the level of $3,600 in the given instance.

Hello again everyone. Today I decided to take a look at Bitcoin  (daily) as ETH took center stage yesterday and did a number on those  bears. Bitcoin decided it was going to follow last night and we  approached resistance. 50k... This 50k resistance is sure a thorn in the  side of the bulls. Speaking of resistance, ETH crushed the resistance  at 3600 which is likely the most recent catalyst to the current bullish  momentum. At least in my opinion.

I see a  possible ascending right triangle pattern, which is generally considered  bullish. These patterns do not always break out as advertised so make  sure you set a stop loss.  There have been consistent higher lows  (bullish) recently and that makes up the bottom of the ascending  triangle. The top is marred by the resistance at 50k. Something's gotta  give. RSI is still low enough for us to break the resistance at 50k.  Time will tell if this comes to pass.   


I am  going slightly off topic here to discuss stop losses on small cap  coins. I understand that sometimes some of you set a stop loss on  these  low cap coins. Then complain about how the stop losses do not trip  consistently. The likely reason for this is low liquidity is to blame.  If you dont have buyers then your stop loss won't trip. That is why I  prefer trading big cap coins like BTC or ETH. There is a reliable amount  of liquidity to trade with confidence in your stop loss. Just something  I wanted to discuss as I have noticed this pattern. People complain  about their stop not tripping. Even trading Bitcoin can result in  skipped stops. But it's much more rare due to the massive liquidity  Bitcoin possesses. WTFDIK??

TLDR: Bitcoin decided it wanted to join the bulls. But 50k is strong resistance. Come on bulls!!!",0.117,0.83,0.053,-0.8476

# 1. Investing in the wrong cryptocurrency

OK, so when it comes to investing in anything, there aren't really clear-cut rights and wrongs. People have made fortunes betting on penny stocks and shiny new cryptos that don't end up going anywhere in the long run. They were just lucky enough to get in and out at the right times. But most people aren't that fortunate.

# 2. Cryptocurrency scams

Just recently, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) announced that more than 7,000 investors lost over $80 million in cryptocurrency scams from October 2020 to March 2021. With so many people interested in cryptocurrency right now, it's easy for scammers to blend in with the crowd.

# 3. Hackers

Because cryptocurrencies are stored in digital wallets and all transactions occur online, hackers are sometimes able to get hold of other people's cryptocurrencies, despite the security measures in place to prevent this.

Back in 2014, a Tokyo-based cryptocurrency exchange named Mt. Gox had to file for bankruptcy after hackers stole the equivalent of $460 million in U.S. dollars. And that's not the only time this sort of thing has happened.

# 4. Password loss

If you lose the password to your cold wallet, you could lose access to your cryptocurrency permanently, even if you've got the wallet right in front of you. If you have a hot wallet -- one that's connected to the internet -- then you might have to worry about other people holding on to their passwords.",0.128,0.825,0.047,-0.9754

09/06/21,"Rationale behind Bitcoin 50k Covered Call 29 Oct 2021 Expiry Trade

At time of writing BTC is trading @ 52k. I’m currently long 0.17 BTC (~$8.6k). Long term I am bullish on bitcoin and crypto in general. However, for the medium term (end of october) my feeling is that BTC is struggling to push through the 52k resistance level. Even if we do break out I don’t see us going any higher than the next 56k resistance level by the end of october. In fact, I think crypto will undergo some regulatory scrutiny during that period which will trigger a pull back to 45k maybe even 40k level.

So my problem is how do I protect my long position in case of a pull back while also capturing some of the upside?

Let’s consider the following scenario if I do nothing and keep my position as is (I did some rounding for ease of reading) based on my current position 0.17 BTC (~$8.6k) 

BTC SPOT TRADING @ 52k = $8.6k

BTC SPOT TRADING @ 55k = $8.6k + $0.4k = $9k

BTC SPOT TRADING @ 60k = $8.6 + $1.4k = $10k

BTC SPOT TRADING @ 45k = $8.6k - $2k = $6.6k

BTC SPOT TRADING @ 40k = $8.6k - $1.2k = $7.4k

As we can see if the market rallies I capture some upside but I have a fair amount of downside risk as well.

Now let’s consider selling 0.5 x 50k Call 29 Oct 2021 Expiry all things being equal (i.e. no change in volatility)

BTC SPOT TRADING @  spot 52k : pnl today 0 / pnl expiry $8.6k + $3k  = 11.6k

BTC SPOT TRADING @  spot 55k : pnl today +$0.2k / pnl expiry $8.6k + $2.4k = 12k

BTC SPOT TRADING @  spot 60k : pnl today -$0.8k / pnl expiry $8.6k + $1k = $9.6k

BTC SPOT TRADING @  spot 45k : pnl today +$0.2k / pnl expiry $8.6k + $2.4k = $12k

BTC SPOT TRADING @  spot 40k : pnl today 0 / pnl expiry $8.6k + $1k = $9.6k

Best case scenario BTC stays within the 45k / 55k range and my profit is $2.4k. Even if we go much higher I would only start losing money if we go above 64k by the end of october. Likewise if we go much lower I would only start losing money if we got below 34k in that time period.

09/10/21,"^(Preamble: Before I go on I just wanted to clarify that I am not trying to encourage anyone to trade options or derivatives. In fact, I strongly discourage most people to use derivatives as they are leveraged investments and can easily go against you and result in losses that go beyond what you have in your trading account. The risk is even greater with highly volatile investments like bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general. Furthermore, derivatives require a very active management and quickly become time consuming. Studies have shown that simple buy and hold - HODL! - strategies have systematically outperformed derivative investments and I strongly recommend that this is what the majority of people should do. However, even if one is not investing in options, they can be really useful tools to interpret what the market may or may not do and the idea here is to exchange views and opinions and these interpretations. I’m also writing this just as much for myself as for anyone else as it helps me keep track of my investment process and gain valuable insight from others’ opinions.

I posted a couple of days ago a trade idea which you can read about [here] I wanted to put on this trade because my feeling was that we had reached a ceiling with the 52k level and while I still wanted to benefit from some upside if we kept on rallying I also wanted to protect my BTC investment from a pullback which I felt could come from some negative regulatory scrutiny. My target trading range was 45k / 55k.

Low and behold BTC took a severe beating a few hours later due to the negative news from the SEC taking interest in the Coinbase lending program. Luck must have been on my side because I couldn’t have possibly timed this if I had wanted to - in fact that’s why I chose a medium term 60 DTE maturity for the trade as I didn’t expect the correction to come so soon.

By selling the 50k BTC Oct21 Calls on Wednesday we collected 0.15 btc ($7.8k) of premium and at time of writing they are trading around 0.1 ($4.5k) therefore locking in a 0.05 ($2.3k) unrealized profit from the decrease in the value of the option. However, since this is a delta neutral trade the long delta hedge 0.5 btc per option has cost us around 0.06 btc ($3k) due to the 10% drop in the value of btc from 52k to 46k.

As intended this trade has mitigated our losses from the correction as the decrease in the value of the option has more or less compensated for the drop in the price of the underlying.

**What now?**

There is still a fair amount of premium in the option therefore we are going to hold the position since the general consensus is that the market will not bounce back quickly and we are looking at a trading range of 40k / 50k for the weeks to come which means that theta decay will chip away at the value of the option netting us some additional profit.

Since we remain bullish it might be a good time to purchase some additional spot since this will enable us to buy some “cheap” btc so we don’t miss out on the next rally while also counteracting the increase in premium of our short call position if the market does move up. That being said macro news may weigh on btc and crypto in general with Fed starts tapering in Q4 so we will be cautious in our btc spot purchase by averaging our buying.

**Was this the best trade or would there have been better trades?**

In the initial post u/LoudOrganization6 suggested selling a 65k strike instead of the 50k. This would have been more suitable for someone more bullish than me and would have captured only 0.05 ($2.6k) btc of premium by selling the 65k call strike for the same expiry. The idea was to maximize the premium income which is why we opted for a slightly ITM call to match our short term bearish outlook.

Another combo by u/LoudOrganization6 would have been to sell a 60k strike Call (0.08 btc) and buy a 45k Put (0.7 btc) which is essentially a Collar. The sale of the Call would have paid for the purchase of the Put. At time of writing the 60k Call is now worth 0.04 btc and the Put 0.12 btc. With hindsight this would have been a much better trade than the Covered Call trade although it would have hurt a bit more in the short term if the market had kept on rallying with the increase in the premium of the call and the collected premium having been used up to pay for the long put.

09/13/21,"**TLDR: Leaving bitcoin on exchanges helps their clients to take short positions on bitcoin (depressing its price) as your bitcoins act as collateral for their trades. If they eventually go bust hard, you will/may pay for their loss.** 

Many people are wondering why the bitcoin price is not going up despite massive institutional buying and increased adoption.  An important reason for that is that bitcoin seems to be suffering from a similar phenomenon (although in a much lower scale at this point) that gold suffers:  The reason why gold is stagnated for years is because there are massive short positions kept by a few key players, which are “subsidized” by a vast amount of “paper gold” in the markets. With bitcoin, this happens through the exchanges.

**People that care about the bitcoin price should stop using exchanges as wallets immediately.** It does not matter that they are safe. They can be 100% safe, insured if you would like, just like your bank deposits. Bitcoins in exchanges aren’t “bitcoin”, they are “paper bitcoin”.  They are a liability for the exchange and an asset for you, but a different asset than if you had the bitcoin in a personal wallet. What you have is a promise from the exchange to have that bitcoins deposited in an address you give should you request a withdraw.  Under normal circumstances, this works well. Under distress situations, it does not. What the exchange has is a promise to pay you back, but only if they can. In many instances, they will not be able to. And that’s fine, they are limited liability companies.  I am confident that the open short interest in bitcoin is substantially large, potentially much bigger than the number of existing bitcoins, or the bitcoin ""free float"".  These short positions are collateralized by bitcoins left in exchanges, regardless if the exchange mentions it explicit or not. Some exchanges are honest and mention it clearly in their terms that in the situation where their insurance fund is depleted, losses will be socialized among winning traders. Others don’t. The bitcoins that you leave in exchanges are used as collateral, explicitly or implicitly, by them to finance short positions of their clients. Even if an exchange does not allow margin trading for retail clients, they very likely do for institutional clients, which is even worse. Notice also that it does not matter if the balance of clients matches what these exchanges have in their wallets. It is practically invisible to outsiders how much institutional clients are leveraged through these exchanges, and a way of estimating or getting a sense of it must be urgently developed for a better understanding of the market. If all those keeping bitcoins at exchanges withdraw them to a private wallet, the exchanges will have to increase their margin requirements for leveraged clients (or reduce the leverage limits), which will force these clients to close their positions or buy more bitcoin. There is no other way, and this of course is good for bitcoin. If people however keep using exchanges as wallets, then we run the risk of bitcoin being constantly manipulated by players who are able to leverage short positions at levels that we cannot even assess.

My recommendation is that those interested in higher bitcoin prices to move their bitcoin to addresses that they, and only they, have control of. This includes those likely making use of custodial services, particularly when custody is made by an exchange. It is quite ironic that many of these investors that buy bitcoin instead of gold because “gold price is manipulated by the banks” do exactly the same gold investors do. If you buy bitcoin to leave it deposited somewhere else under a custodian,  particularly if this custodian has clients that can short bitcoin, you are very likely doing a disservice for bitcoin. Move your bitcoins immediately somewhere else, buy insurance if necessary, or leave them with a custodian that performs only custody and nothing else. The reason by the way why custodian services are usually cheaper than insurance is precisely because the custodian can profit on you (by having your precious bitcoins in custody) in other ways.

As long as we have bitcoins being left in exchanges or in the hands of custodians that fill very much the role of the same banks that bitcoin holders aim to be disconnected from, we will have bitcoin moving sideways and fighting hard for higher price levels.

In the end, inevitably, bitcoin prices will grow. But this process can be much faster if each bitcoin holder takes care of its own bitcoins or leave them with true custodians, not exchanges.",0.069,0.827,0.104,0.9904

I'll say right from the beginning that I know absolutely nothing about investing in cryptocurrencies. Although I periodically make investments in stocks (in fact, they are made by my father's broker that manages at his own discretion the money I entrust him), I've never invested in Bitcoin since the broker rejected this option as extremely risky and advised me to do cryptocurrency myself if I'm so eager to venture into it.

The problem is that the only thing I know is that cryptocurrency exists, and you can make money on it, and this is where my knowledge ends. I've read several books about blockchain, but it didn't become clearer where and how to start. 

I'm wondering if there is any clarifying course that will explain on the fingers how to start investing in bitcoin on your own. I'm searching for a visual aid about registering on the exchanging platform, some clear explanation of the meaning of each abbreviation, how to buy, and how to sell. What indicators to pay attention to before making a decision. I want a step-by-step manual from registering to real-time actions.  

I'm subscribed to many crypto channels on Telegram and Discord, I even joined [ some days ago and bought their weekly membership, but their level is for more advanced traders than mine.

In the previous post I mentioned how bullish it would be if Bitcoin broke above a rising channel. Well today that became a reality, so now it's time to remind the trader's not to FOMO. And what I will be doing to ensure I buy in at correct places.

Updated [Bitcoin] chart. Just a reminder not to chase big green candles. Bitcoin is booming and its exciting! But make sure to make smart trades. Bitcoin is overextended bullish, which would imply a small correction or at least price settling is due. That should set up for nice potential buys on the retest of the rising channel. There is an enormous wall of buyers waiting on that so it should be strong support.

If Bitcoin can just cool off it's indicators and track sideways, then there will be some good altcoin trading coming. Best way to track this is with [Bitcoin Dominance] Im watching a potential double top on smaller timeframes. This double top could overlap with bitcoin cooling off, which means money flows heavily into altcoins. Dont jump in too early.

And if Bitcoin Dominance and Bitcoin do cooperate for altcoin trading, its wise to have a plan ahead of time, this prevents panic and bad decisions. My plan is to start charting some Defi tokens, because [DEFI-Perp] actually made a small move WHILE bitcoin was taking all the money in the market. And there is a low volume node to the upside so its possible that Defi will move quickly.

Profiting in Bitcoin means your total satoshis (the number of BTCs you own) rise. In the final game, when fiat currencies die, the only thing that matters is Bitcoin. When calculating profit, you need to use the correct accounting unit. Bitcoin is the superior unit of account, not the downward trending dollar.

Now you are using BTC to evaluate your wealth, what would you do? Do you trade Bitcoin? Do you trade other cryptocurrencies? Are you trying to seize market opportunities and buy low and sell high? Do not. The easiest way to profit in Bitcoin is to buy and HODL. That's it. Nothing complicated. It will not take up your day's time, and you don't even have to think about it.

The beauty of Bitcoin is that it is not an investment, but a savings. When you invest, you invest the money you earn from your daily work in assets such as stocks and real estate, hoping to make a profit by selling it in the future. You have to use your money to buy assets, and your investment may be bad. Saving is about saving the money you earn, simply saving it-not investing your Bitcoin in other assets that you want to get a return on, but letting it sit there and do nothing.",0.08,0.743,0.177,0.975

[Bitcoin 1hr] Since ATH, we have been working out way down in this falling wedge. Looks to be moving out of it this morning but Im not expecting this to explode back to all time highs immediately. Funding rates are STILL high. I think it is very possible that bitcoin crabs sideways for the next week. I'm not trying to predict here, but what we are waiting on is people need to lose faith in bitcoin about to run, THATS when it will happen. So Im looking for a crab walk, people begin to doubt the bullish momentum, longs get closed, then we are off to the races.

In the event of crab walking, we need to look at our macro target. All we want from some crabbing is a [Bitcoin Monthly] candle to be the highest close in history.

If there is a crab walk from bitcoin, alts could have a good week. Not guaranteed at all, have to keep an eye on the TOTAL charts, BTC.D, ALTPERP, DEFIPERP, and NFT dominance.

10/25/21,"Today's tip that I would like to remind any traders is to be sure you are using multiple timeframes to nail your entries. This will mostly apply to swing traders, but the concept is surely beneficial to anyone.

Basically, regardless of the timeframe you are used to using for trading, you can always zoom into a lower timeframe to dial in entries on coins. Here's an example from today using ICP:

[ICP 4hr chart] This chart shows that ICP had a decent run today. It didn't moon, but 20% in a  single day is great! And if you wanted to get in on this after it started moving, you should know how to do that safely. So for that we need to zoom in timeframes.

Here's what you would've seen on a 5 minute timeframe [ICP 5 min] A bull pennant comes in super clear and by the time you have the pattern nicely identified, you would've had 2 support entry opportunities.

And this is how it would've played out [ICP 5 min hindsight] Notice my example isnt perfect, ICP actually had a small pullback because bitcoin was acting up for a little. But, because of the strategic entry, you never would've been sitting in a loss!



My example here is looking at pretty short term moves, but even if you are a macro trend trader, you can zoom into 1-4hr timeframes to find patterns. I encourage you to at least give it a try. If you are unsure, feel free to message me and I'll provide some feedback at no cost :)",0.05,0.747,0.203,0.9941

10/26/21,"During this run I'm focused on growing my BTC so, all of my interest is paid in that one for now (I lend it in a lending platform \~%8 APY for BTC and ETH, \~12% on USDC). But the time will come when the market sags, it's a part of it. 

So check this out: You can park USDC, ETH, and BTC on Hodlnaut. And, you can get your interest paid in any of the currency they deal with AND, and this is a BIG AND, you can direct each of your holdings to pay interest in the currency of your choice.



I don't sell my BTC or ETH, because then it grows slower. When we hit what looks like the top of the run, I'll focus the velocity to USDC to have something to buy the dip with! 

You can also get USDC in USDC, which itself grows at 12.5 APY while directing ETH to pay BTC and BTC to pay ETH. 

Point: you can choose each coins interest independently of the others.

10/26/21,"There are a couple major trends with Bitcoin price action currently on several timeframes and I want to share them with the community because I don't think a lot of people view the market through this lens. 

Starting with smaller timeframes. [Bitcoin 1hr] is sitting in a nice falling wedge. These often break higher and with the bullish market and general news, things are looking good. Just a waiting game right now. Often falling wedges form a double bottom right before breakout, so if we don't come down to the blue support trendline then that is likely the last swing low we will see. Additionally, $59,300 range should provide pretty good support to encourage that to play out.

On the [Bitcoin Daily] chart, we are currently retesting some super bullish ideas. Again sitting on very strong support so if this breaks lower and back into the pattern then that would be a very bad sign.



I'll leave it at that basic level of analysis right now. If you have questions, please ask and I'll do my best to address them. If you are a holder for life and hate any kind of analysis like this, well that's alright too. I absolute commend that strategy.

11/06/21,"I'm always preaching to find confluence between charts for market moves. And this doesn't always work perfectly, but it is such an edge to this market that most traders do not see.

We are able to time some really big moves out of Bitcoin by doing some basic technical analysis on bitcoin dominance. And [BTC.D] is currently nearing the end of a really step falling wedge, and we love wedges because they come to an apex.   
\*\*REMEMBER: Bitcoin Dominance does not tell us the direction of a big move, just preludes that a big move may be coming\*\*

So the next step is to look at the Bitcoin chart. [Bitcoin 1hr] shows us that Bitcoin has been in a falling channel since it broke a new all time high. And this makes sense because Bitcoin has needed to cool off and reset funding rates.

Statistically speaking, both of those patterns should break higher, but they could also break lower and it's important to have a plan in place for all scenarios. So here are the 4 scenarios and how they each play out differently.

1. BTC.D and BTC both break higher : Bitcoin breaks higher from the falling channel, the bitcoin rally begins, and BTC.D is increasing because FOMO is driving new money into the market and Bitcoin is pumping like an altcoin
2. BTC.D and BTC both break lower : Bitcoin likely would pull back to the lower support of the falling channel and bulls would have to hope that support level holds. And because BTC.D breaks lower, most altcoin will remain stable, with few big gainers.
3. BTC.D breaks higher, BTC breaks lower : Bitcoin likely would pull back to the lower support of the falling channel and bulls would have to hope that support level holds. And because BTC.D breaks higher, all altcoins will get wrecked. When bitcoin goes down and bitcoin dominance goes up, there is blood is the streets.
4. BTC.D breaks lower, BTC breaks higher : This is a market euphoria scenario. Almost all coins are green, tons of double digit green altcoins. Almost no way to lose in this scenario unless you are late to the party and FOMO at the top.

But notice that there are only 2 charts here, and we can at least paint some pictures for possibilities. It's important to plan for each scenario because the last thing you want is to wake up in the morning, check your coins to realize your entire portfolio has dropped a zero, and hope that emotion-filled you is going to make the right choice in that moment. You need to check the plan you said you were sticking to, and follow it.

11/11/21,"Hi everyone! I'm not much of a trader, but I figured this would be the best sub to ask my question.

Most of my net worth is in Bitcoin, and I currently don't have an income source because I quit my software job. I'm living off liquid savings, which will probably run out by early next year. I'm now focused exclusively on personal projects with the intent to create passive income doing things that are more meaningful to me.

My original intent with Bitcoin was to hodl most of my stack for the long-term, because I believed Bitcoin would be at the center of a transformed financial system. Now I'm starting to feel like that's a bit naive, and that it's wiser to take moderate profits into fiat, because then I'll have more cash on hand to reinvest into other projects, or to pay my bills if I still haven't managed to produce any income. I came up with a simple, somewhat optimistic strategy for the next year or two, and was hoping you all could critique it and make suggestions.

The idea is to sell incrementally, beginning at $100k and ending at $300k, selling at every $20k increase. If the whole range plays out, my entire stack will be sold, and that would mean I got out, on average, at $200k, which is my ideal target. If the range doesn't play out, I'll be glad to have been able to take some profits and have money on hand to reinvest into a Bitcoin bear market, into other projects, or into myself.

I understand that we might not even hit $100k anytime soon, and so after a significant run-up, I will probably take a little money out of alts, just to keep me going while I don't have any income.

11/15/21,"I recently came across a Twitter thread by Fidelity's [Jurrien Timmer] director of global macro, posted back in April of this year. The thread explores Timmer's unique price-performance model. In [THIS] thread Timmer suggests that the S2F model is unidimensional, and a model incorporating demand may yield more accurate results.
  
His research suggests that BTC demand thus far has closely followed that of cell phone demand. Timmer extrapolated this logarithmic relationship based on historic BTC data and mapped it against the S2F model. The result is [THIS] figure which presents a bracketed price model based on the 2 variables.
  
This model suggests an EOY price bracketed by $37.6k (demand) and $98k (S2F). As a long-term holder, I appreciate what I perceive to be a more sensible and subdued approach to price prediction versus those circulating in most BTC circles. The lower bottom end of Timmer's model may be seen as bearish by some. However, I suspect that the bottom end is fairly conservative based on recent market price action which suggests consolidation in the '60s. Ultimately, I view his model as a positive and productive contribution to better understanding BTC price action moving forward.

Beyond the model, I believe it is extremely bullish for BTC to receive analysis as a high-performance asset from this longstanding and reputable TradFi institution. I am absolutely dumbfounded that more people aren't talking about the state of institutional adoption.

11/15/21,"I normally post super simple TA setups, but figured I would share some of the stranger analysis as food for thought. Bitcoin is almost always either just repeating a pattern it has recently made, mirroring a pattern its made, or flipping the pattern its recently made. That sounds like a lot of possibilities but when you start getting into the weeds you can see where it can occasionally help.

Obviously, I cannot tell the future, but I am using a real-time example here for demonstration. This analysis will be 2 parts; the first part showing a pattern bitcoin made recently on 3hr timeframe. And the second part showing a potential repeating pattern happening on 1 hr timeframe.

[BTC 3hr] the main thing to look at here is the section with 3 green triangles. Bitcoin is constantly printing these, it leads to a ton of head and shoulder type of patterns, but they arent always perfectly horizontal (for example the one I am showing is slanted on an angle).

Now if we zoom in to the [BTC 1hr] we can find an almost identical formation. These aren't perfectly shaped which can make them more difficult to spot. But there is a chance that we get a repeating pattern and bitcoin is about to have a nice little run again.

I'm not saying I am a fortune teller, but patterns like this show up and play out all the time. You guys always criticize that I never provide any ""predictions"" on my posts and the answer is because predictions are dumb and impossible. But I'm putting it out there now because this is a speculative idea I am currently running with and would love to see if it plays out or doesnt.

Regardless of how it turns out, I would like any other traders or charters to try and back test this idea to see how often it actually works out. It may just end up being another tool in your toolbox.",0.059,0.829,0.112,0.9356

[1] The 2021 PA is like a hybrid of 2013 (featuring a double top with a sustained lull in between) and 2017 (featuring a cycle of ATHs, dips, and new ATHs for a 9-month period).  2021 had a 5+-month… struggle… from May to late September, with periodic ATH resets prior to, and following, that time out.

&amp;nbsp;

[2] The dips in 2017 were **not** appreciably harsher than this year.  Indeed, the 53% dip in May 2021 was by far the worst of either cycle.  But the gains (measured by % increase of each new ATH over the prior one) were much more generous in 2017.  The most recent four ATHs in 2021 saw increases of 5, 5, 3, and 2%, respectively.  By contrast, the final three ATHs in 2017 included increases of 59% and 51% over the prior ATHs (set just weeks earlier). 

&amp;nbsp;

[3] The dips were ‘quicker’ in 2017 - the time between a new ATH and the next local low was shorter in 2017 than this year.  That is likely why the comparative percentage decreases between 2017 and 2021 might not sync with your (my!) memory of 2017 feeling WAY more out of control.  It was, in this sense: The giant 52% plummet in mid April 2021 played out over 5 weeks before leveling out.  By contrast, new ATHs in 2017 dropped 20, 30, or 40% *in several days* before pushing back to ‘surface’ and resuming the upward movement.  The price dropped 20% *in one day* on Nov 30, 2017.  The insane pace of new highs in 2017 is why people “remember” going straight from $5,500 in mid November to $20,000 a month later; in reality, besides the one-day Nov 30 dump, there was also a 28% drop in early December before the final run to $20K.

&amp;nbsp;

[4] We had 10 ATH resets between March and December 2017.  Measuring from the same halving-plus-8-months point in this halving cycle (Jan 2021), we’ve had “only” 6 ATH resets in 2021.  But this data supports an increasingly popular theory from the Daily thread, regarding a longer cycle.  The ‘boom’ part of this halving cycle started in Dec 2020 (halving-plus-7) when the Dec 2017 ATH was taken out; we saw the most recent new ATH last week at **month 18 of the 2020-21 cycle**.  By contrast, the 2016-17 cycle lasted 17 months from halving to peak; and the 2012-13 cycle lasted 13 months.

&amp;nbsp;

[5] I incorrectly (and rather rudely in tone) challenged u/jarederaj for claiming there was a 25% dip in December 2017 the week before that cycle’s true ATH.  He was correct.  I was incorrect.  I was wrong.  I apologize for my poor facts and feline-distemper-level words; and I thank him for his patience and tolerance.

*TLDR: Making strategic moves and planning ahead can make trading this market more enjoyable than stressful. I want to help other traders (or aspiring traders) get more comfortable with this and learn how to move in this market. I post some setups on reddit, but working on moving myself to a public server so others can get more of my charts and I can help those that are interested.*

One of the questions or topics I get asked the most is about how to remain level headed when making trades. Of course, this only applies to people that are buying and selling; DCA and HODL strategies are not impacted by this.

Many people have different strategies for how to manage this, but hopefully by providing mine it will help some of those that don't even know where to start. I struggled with this for a long time before I found my strategy and got comfortable with it.

The two main pieces for me are actually having a plan before making a trade and being confident on my entries to trades. And you HAVE to stick to the plan, too many people say they have a plan but deep down they know that the plan is not flushed out or complete and so they don't follow it.

The hardest part of this strategy is starting it, once you start it's easy to maintain. Reason for that is you need to wait for the proper entry and sitting on the sidelines is hard for some people because they feel they always need to be in a trade. But the name of the game is to chart any of the coins of interest, I chart BTC and have support/resistance levels and good patterns drawn on all of my charts. I have heavy support levels marked on the charts and in all of the places where you'd thing ""dang, it would be awesome in this pulled back here"". And I mark those levels on a ton of coins I'm interested and I set alerts at or near those levels.

And this is the hard part, you wait. Wait for those good entry levels to get hit. If the entire market pumps hard and new levels are reached, I adjust the levels on my charts accordingly but still don't buy in until they are hit. The entire goal here is to buy when the price is on its way down or sideways, not the way up.

And then it happens, a market correction or small dip to correct longs occurs. And those targets start to get hit, I start to get alerts that the prices are closing towards my targets. And I scale into them slowly, in the event that the dip goes beyond my targets and I can get an even sweeter price. I do this in a distributed fashion across some of the coins that I'm most interested in and feel they will have best bounce up (this can be based on coin news coming out soon or technical patterns that are stronger than others).

Because I enter on confidence at those levels, I don't have to worry about the endless dip. I know that if the prices continue to dump below the technical patterns I have drawn, I sell because the pattern I set up for failed. Sure I took a small loss, but we are generally talking no more than 5-7%, not the 40%+ many others take in altcoins. Then we re-analyze the charts with the next support levels, and enter again on those levels because a correction to the upside is bound to be soon if our first targets got demolished. (There are better ways to expect the next bounce support levels, this can be determined by charting BTC with the altcoins of interest; just wanted to clarify it's not randomly done at every support level).

Then the market starts to do it's correction back to the upside. Even if not a big or rapid correction, I am almost immediately in profit because I entered on support. So doing that negatives almost all of the negative/sad emotions of crypto because I ride almost no downtrends, and if I do its very short term. And now we use our charts to look at where the overhead resistance levels will be, we can chart and get an idea of when to expect a pullback or correction in the market. And when I think that correction is around the corner, I sell my holdings. Depending on the market and charting, I will do this in portions as certain resistance levels or targets are reached. I have to know to be happy with my profits.

While that uptrend is happening and I am just letting my setups play out, I continue to chart and scope out my next moves. Planning for that next correction or swing downward already. So while I take my profit and wait, I have the game plan already in motion so there are no rush decisions. And as I sit on the sidelines, its a perfect time to reflect on any mistakes I might have made if something didn't go right or learn other technical concepts, etc.",0.035,0.822,0.143,0.9987

12/02/21,"It’s impossible to trade or invest and not find yourself into a losing position. That’s just the way things are. And a large trading loss can be devastating, not only financially, but emotionally. Losses are a natural part of trading, but that doesn't make them any easier to handle. We don’t like losses, and we’ll do almost anything to avoid taking them. 

The number one thing I want to make sure of when I have a losing trade is that I didn't fail in the execution, because that still can happen right like you get in late or you take a signal that's not really that good. If everything is correct with your trading plan which should define where you will enter and exit a trade, then you should be fine. In a situation like this, where you have a defined trading plan there is nothing to contemplate because you should be confident that in the long run, your strategy will bring you good profit.

It is also crucial to define your potential losses before you enter any trade. Define your possible loss, or risk, in comparison to your possible reward, or profit. It is also important that you don’t take losing personally. Traders who put their self-esteem on the line with their money are especially vulnerable to strong, unpleasant emotions when they lose. But if you take a more carefree approach, and think, “It is not personal; it isn’t a big deal in the end,” then you will be able to accept a loss and take quick, decisive action.

You should also analyze each loss. It is not an enjoyable activity to do, but all successful traders would say that honest and brutal analysis of each loss is what helped them recover and turn their trading for the better. Analyzing losses can help you improve your trading plan which can only make you a more profitable trader in the future.

Also, it is good to realize that trading is an endless process of learning. Just like in real life you learn more from your mistakes than from your victories. Losing money should motivate you to look improve your strategy, read more about trading and become more disciplined. Next time, you will have a better idea of what happened and where you went wrong and can open up room for improvement and start stacking the odds in your favor.

It sounds obvious, but putting your focus out of making money and into enjoying the process, will keep you on the right track and more likely to end up in profit.",0.152,0.637,0.211,0.9893

We wanted to share a brief market update today given the overnight volatility. Here are the recap and observations from our team:
 
QUICK TAKEAWAYS:

Bitcoin declined nearly 20% overnight as the weak price action to end the week extended overnight into a less liquid weekend session. The effects were even more severe on offshore exchanges like Huobi, where bitcoin hit $28,800 at its lowest point.


$1.1B of leveraged BTC positions and $2.5B of crypto leveraged positions (including bitcoin) have been liquidated in the past 24 hours. This is the largest notional liquidated since September 7th. To put this into context, 6.4% of offshore leveraged positions were liquidated in the past 24 hours. The highest number of liquidations that have occurred within the past year is about 28% of total open interest, which happened when $3.5B worth of futures were liquidated on April 18.
Bitcoin implied volatility (IV) had knee jerked higher across the term structure, with 1 week at-the-money IV spiking above 100%. 

However, the overall IV levels have settled back quickly back in the high 70%-mid 80% range. The term structure is back in contango this morning, reflecting what’s expected in a normalized environment, after going into backwardation overnight.


Perpetual swap funding rates have flipped to negative on a handful of offshore exchanges such as Bybit, Deribit, and Huobi, their lowest level since September.

As institutional investors have started to get involved in crypto, we have been seeing more and more similarities to the stock markets and as such, we saw our first Wyckoffian patterns February to April in 2021. Followed by a very obvious accumulation pattern.  
 
We have recently had two distributions to follow and it looks like we might enter another accumulation phase. While I do believe there is a chance we could see a strong recovery and continue this bull market, we have to account for the possible play that is at hand.  
 

IF we fail to get over the bull market support band on a weekly timeframe as shown in this chart by a 20w sma and 21w ema , we might enter such an accumulation phase.  
 

What are my price levels based on?  
 

* Since 2011, if we held the bull market support band at a certain point, we have never again went below it. As you can see, we did test the Band for 10 days at the end of September.  
 
* We have seen previous accumulations and distributions which have formed significant points of support and resistance  
 

If we do get into accumulation, it would be wise to DCA  throughout and hold some cash in stablecoins for a possible spring event (orange path). Should there be none, at least you DCA'd through the accumulation.  
I still believe we will see higher prices by Q1 or Q2 of 2022, as the cycles do seem to lenghten. 69k is unlikely to have been the top.",0.013,0.872,0.114,0.9712

12/13/21,"Asking this for a friend who is not on reddit :

He has a technical trend identification model for **positional** traders in crypto. Earlier he was using this for commodities and forex market but he found it to be more useful in crypto because of the continuous nature of the markets. It is a very simple model and easy to understand. It consists of 2 proprietary indicators and just by looking at it anyone can figure out what is the underlying trend of that particular instrument.  This model has served well in the recent bull and bear market scenarios and as well as in times when markets are choppy.

He is not a very wealthy individual and can't put lot of money in trading his own model though he is doing it in a smaller scale. But he feels that to realize the true potential of his model bigger amount of money needs to be involved. He is ready to share his signals with anyone  for free for next couple of months to demonstrate the effectiveness of his model.

Do you chart Bitcoin (and other cryptos) in any particular currency? I always used to use USD but recently I decided to use GBP (as I am British).

I think that different currencies give different results (I am still a semi noob as you can tell from that statement) however on GBP I have found a natural angle trendline and the 250MA seems to run a little smoother compared to using the USD.

Be interested to see if people use one currency over others for their TA, or use multiple currencies.

The 69k top is the absolute top for the bear to long term future . i do believe btc will continue to retrace into the 50s possible 58 at some point but we will not see 69k or above ! i have posted on this subject before and gotten destroyed for it but this is not me being a bear but me looking at TA and historic price charts and making an educated decision on BTC. i do think we see btc hit the 35k market after some light retracing . then i think we head to the high 50s for the last retracement . that will be the end of the BTC run for the near future . I believe BTC will hit 8-10k before 70k. i am sure i will get trashed for this but if you are new to trading crypto or interested in an opposing view from the youtube gurus then this would be it . I love BTC and will be buying as much as possible when it finally touches down into the 8-10k mark whenever that is .. but for now i see small peaks and valleys into a final retracement and then it’s over

12/19/21,"I started simple trading in 2018. Okay it wasn’t really trading. I downloaded BUX, invested 100 EUR and bought Netflix shares. Over time I observed how the value went up and down and realized that there is a chance to sell high and to rebuy low. I did it and slowly slowly made some money. I started my research about trading, opened my trading view account to do technical analysis, watched videos on YouTube, listened to Podcasts you name it. 

Even in the very first book I read there was the importance of a trading journal mentioned. I started it but stopped it pretty soon because of the effort. Instead I tried all those promising trading strategies people talked about and over time my trading got worse. Really. I learned so hard but the impact wasn’t positive but negative. 

After I nearly lost all my wins I made a hard stop. Something had to change. So I researched again. But this time about trading journals. How others do and use them. I can’t remember the guy's name but there was this guy who maintained a huge EXCEL sheet and collected lots of data for each trade he did. He even backtested with this sheet. 

In the end he was able to predict the success of a trade based on all confluences involved in a trade. Confluences like…

“Bullish Divergence on the daily time frame”

“Retrace to 0.618 Fibonacci”

“RSI oversold on 4H time frame”

“Bullish engulfing candle on 1H time frame”

…and many more.

He also combined those confluences with the hard facts like instruments, day time etc. There are really specific times where specific instruments can go crazy. For example Tuesdays are really interesting when you want to trade Bitcoin. 

It was a lot of effort. But I also lost a lot of money so I decided to give it a try. I extended the idea and also added my mood and sleep to the journal. If you ever opened a trade just because you lost another and wanted to try to get your money back, you know how important discipline is. I also added trading view screenshots to my trades as proofs for the confluences I was seeing.  

Over time my trading improved. Not just my trading. My confidence in my trades increased and therefore I was able to handle stop losses and risk so much better. The result was high risk to reward ratio trades and less losing trades. I also needed less time for trading. I just opened the high confidence trades and because of this I also reduced the daily time for trading from fairly 6 hours per day to a maximum of 1 hour per day. 

I’m a developer. So it was no coincidence that I started to think about using machine learning. My goal was to predict the trades chance to win upfront. I used all the data I collected over time and started to train the algos. It worked and with the help of machine learning I was able to increase my trading results again. I still do because the predections are getting better and better over time. 

Finally I’m not just a developer. As a guy who worked more than 15 years in startups as founder or in leading tech and product positions I also love to build great products and great product teams. This is why I started my journey to build a trading journal app to help myself, but even more important, and others to improve their trading strategies over time. 

I made a plan to release an app, traders can use via the web or as a mobile app. I created my first landing page and also a Kickstarter campaign to validate the demand for such an app. 

Now I’m curious. Would you use such an app? What would you expect from it? Which questions would come to your mind? What are your experiences with trading journals? Let me know and if you like what I do feel free to support the project too. ",0.073,0.738,0.19,0.9984

I ended up with 3 algorithms (2 which are making around 20 trades per month and 1 which is making 2-3 trades per month on average). 
Actually for now it seems that I did it because since 27.08.21 to 26.12.21 bitcoin gained ~8% and my algorithms made me ~26% which is roughly 100% per year. I know that 4 months are too short period of time to make any conclusions for the next years, but in the last 4 months bitcoin went through many shitty price actions(fast dumps, pumps and consolidations)..which gives me confidence.

12/30/21,"greetings fellow coiners. Wishing you all the best at this time of the year.

First, thank you for all the good stuff you bring to this thread, and making it the best place on the net to discuss Bitcoin insights.

Then, I would like to give back some of my own thoughts of the recent months. I'm very interested in getting your feeback.
I was not sure whether it should be a separate post / thread or not. Anyway, here it goes.

Like others have said, looking at the minute or even daily moves of the price is futile. Interesting, like a soap drama is, but futile.

So now that we're at the end of the 4 year cycle, or rather what used to be the 4 year cycle (more ahead), is a good time to try to get the bigger picture and take a look ahead where the price might go in the next cycle.

However, predicting price is fun, but there are very few chances that predicted prices actually happen in the predicted way. Rather, what is easier to be predicted are the successsive trends the price will take. And what is actually truly useful is to outline the big underlaying principles that will make them happen.

Let's first take a look backwards. 4 years ago, at the end of the previous cycle, I thought I had nailed it and understood how price would move : more or less like 4 years earlier. This proved mostly correct throughout 2018... except that we had a descending triangle rather than a descending channel. Why ? because bottoms were skimmed.

This ""small"" change made a big difference at the end of the year, were the price dropped a cliff and got halved from 6k to 3k. And an even bigger difference in the first half of 2019, when this sudden drop gave birth to the complementary opposite reaction : a rally all the way up to 14k. I think it's fair to say that this rally suprised most people, and at least that such a 4 year bear market rally was unprecedented in the whole history of Bitcoin. However, looking back, all of this looks now rather consistent and logical ; rounded bottoms and tops have become the norm rather than the exception, as is the increased RELATIVE volatility of the price even though within less large bounds.

All of this is nothing new, but this gives us a good overview of how new big trends have increasingly hanged the historical behaviour of Bitcoin, and what are the ""new"" - actually, rather ""updated"" - principles behind price moves. So here they are.

Historical trends remain :

- price staying within historical regressions. I'm very fond of the one where the bottom line doubles, and the top one increases by half every year. It was a 3k- end of 2017, is now at 25-100k, and will be at 400-500k end of the next cycle (end of 2025). This tightening also shows that soon after or before that, it will have to break, probably down since the bottom line is more unsustainable long term (26000k in 10 years !!). Besides, tops getting skimmed means that we'll probably never see again the upper limits of it.
- impact of halving every 4 year. However I'm NOT saying that we'll still get a mind-blowing blow-off top after.
- well known price patterns will repeat... until they are broken. Same for short term and longer term trendlines.
- Bitcoin price, like all markets, always does the most unexpected move, in order to take money from the majority.

But they are been modified by big trends such as institutional adoption &amp; ETFs :

- institutional money is big and plays like in other markets to get their share : they use futures to skim off tops and bottoms, making them rounded. So now more blow-off, 80% drop or deep dip with V shaped recovery (black swan like Covid crash being the exception)
- institutional money wants volatility, so they take advantage of rounded tops and bottoms to push the price in the other direction more than it would be without them.
- institutional money wants yearly returns, so there is an increased chance that every year will have some kind of ""incredible"" rally, even cycle bear market years, such as the 2019 one.
- I'd go on a limb and say that institutional money like an appealing product, so if they can get a new high every year they will.

Now that we've got the big principles nailed down, let's use them to draw what would be a possible evolution of the price in the upcoming 4 year cycle. Again, this is the part that is the most fun, but the less useful. Don't trade on these prices, Bitcoin always does the unexpected, and trends will keep on changing. However, it shows how to use the big principles to get a picture of what might come, and have a steadier hand at the helm.

2022 :

- right now, it is plausible to say that what happend in the April-July bear repeats. So after a short relieve (that just happened, up to 52k), price will contine going down sideways, down to 45k up to mid-February. Moreover, institutional money first needs time to get a position again for further 2022 rallies. Yes, China selling pressure will end, but that's not going have an impact on day one.

- Then my idea is that it will be much like the 2018 rally to 10k, because the rally to 12k first only happend because of the 70% drop, which we won't have. we will have a retest of 53k that will first fail, but then succeed in a rally further up ending in May (2 months earlier than last time, like everything seems to happen). And then ""sell in May and go away"". Institutional money needs a nice rally to get their earnings in 2022. Maybe it'll end at 65k, with everyone being dead sure that anyway it'll end only 2k higher (so 71k) ? But it will be a good opportunity to trick them into FOMOing at the top, with the ""extended cycle"" talks. In this case, the new ATH will be defined by a new upper line. A good one is the one going through the 2017 and 2021 tops, which triples every 3 years or so, is now at 70k, at 210k end of 2024 and 1900k end of 2030. This line would define a new ATH at 82k in May.

- then price will at first make people believe price will go to 100k (at last !) and there won't be a 4 year bear market anymore. But whales will milk all these ""100k is next door"" new converts. So still no 100k then. And it will actually break the big trend lines up that remain, probably at 60k start of August, and drop down to 40k or even 30k start of September 2022. BTW, 100k can only happen once everybody is disillusioned and thinks that new attempts are pointless. What made me doubt of 100k end of 2021 was all these ""300k blow-off top"" predictions at the start of the year, like 100k would be a sure thing.

- there it will be all doom and gloom, and people will expect the price to get halved down (like end 2018) to 20k or even 15k, but it most probably won't happen - actually, can't happen anymore. Bear market length went down from 6-9 months in 2014 to 4-6 months in 2018, depending on how bounds are drawn, so this time it would be 2.7-4 months. So it would end before the end of the year, and the price would go back up to 50k, where lies the big trend line and the lower line of the historical regression. Except if institutional money needs more time to get their position at the start of 2023 ; then everybody would fear the big trend line and regression are broken, but I think whales will have more interest in milking their fears and in the end push the price back up. But who knows.

- What's more interesting is that if and when it were to break down, it would have to find support and another trend line to later follow up. The simplest one is a parallel one drawn from the Covid drop bottom, and it merely always sits 25% below it ; it also was a support in the 2015 bear market. 25% lower is not bad, but it still ends up at 300k end of 2025. Another one goes through the 3k and the Covid drop bottoms ; it sat at 5k start of 2020, will be at 40k start of 2025 so gets *8 every 5 years and will be at 320k in 3030. But I think this one is premature at this moment. It will get its time in the limelight, but probably not for years to come.

2023 :

- from there, it seems logical we'll have a big rally, born of the big bear market dip, much like in 2019. Except that back then, 20k hadn't been a skimmed off top, but a blow off top. Note that if 100k has been skimmed to 69k, 20k would have been skimmed down to 14k incidentally ! Where up to ? at least 70k as we've just seen. But I believe that we'll rather see a new high. It is counterintuitive (which is good for whales) at this time of the cycle, but it is the logical conclusion of the ""blow-off top skimming"" principle. And all the more if we didn't get a new ATH in 2022, because then 70k would already be a new ATH, so it will draw a lot of attention. I'll even wager that it'll take 100k, up to 105-140k on said new upper trend line made of the 2017 and 2021 tops. This is where institutional money will get their earnings this year.

- then the price might only fall. I don't know where to or when, maybe the previous 60k tops, repeating this year's pattern of halving down abruptly - again, ""sell in May and go away"". But to follow the regression's bottom line, it has to be above 100k at end of 2023. Will it again ? or will it cling a new bottom line, the one 25% below at 75k ? or free fall to find a new support down, and make everyone fear that the halving effect is gone for good ?

From then on :

- in 2024 we'll have the perennial halving short term rally, If it's again 2 months earlier, it'll be too early for institutional money to get their earnings from it, so there would be another rally later that year (after a drop where they can build their position), ending in September. If the price did cling to said trend line, at least one of those would make a new high, up to 170-250k on said trend line.

- now, what's interesting is that at this time and at this price, said 20k-60k tops trend line makes an ascending triangle with the regression's lower bound. So it now has to break. Up or down ? I don't know. My heart says up, in this case up to 240-500k in 2025, but most probably the fabled 300-350k. Indeed, 300k is the previous cycle tops trend line. And 350k is the 70% skimmed off the regression's 500k upper line. But 300k is also the ""25% below"" lower trend line, which means that we would have had to broke it down earlier and find new support. So maybe this time we would have broken it end of 2024 in a catastrophic manner, that would still allow for an institutional money-desired rally in 2025, but with 2025 being still already full cycle bear market. This would be bad for the morale, so maybe it would have broken down earlier, and we would have had a halving rally and post halving rally worth of the name, as in the good old times. In any way, this shows the limits of the exercise, which has now come to an end.

Finally, looking back at this scenario :

- I admit that a new ATH every year is a little bit rosy, like never again going below 40k or 30k even. But so much depends on what will happen by then.
- next cycle's ATH will very probably be between 240k (previous cycle tops trend line end of 2024, at 300k end of 2025) and 350k (70% of the regression's upper line end of 2025).
- following an upper line 300k in 4 years means doing *4, which is more than what the price has done in the current cycle up to now. So I think that there's margin for a new ATH before that, so in the first half of either 2022 or 2023.
- but beware, long term support lines are far and few below...",0.051,0.834,0.115,0.9993

Hey everyone! I wanted to share an early look at a web app I've been developing these past few months called DCA Stack (Dollar Cost Averaging Stack). DCA Stack is an automated dollar collar cost averaging bot that can purchase bitcoin (and altcoins) on over 100 exchanges. Did I also mention that this is **completely free** to use?

&amp;nbsp;

I built this because I was fed up how difficult it was to Dollar Cost Average. I wanted to use my favorite exchanges but found that they had outrageous fees for the recurring buy option. The only options after that were costly services that would automate DCA or placing them manually like a peasant. I figured there had to be a better way so I put some weekends into developing this web app to restore everyone's purchasing power.

&amp;nbsp;

It's still a super early release of DCA Stack but it's functional. I'd love to gather the community's feedback, thoughts and concerns so I can make this even better for everyone.

&amp;nbsp;

EDIT: Just wanted to address one crucial detail on how this bot operates. It works by API keys generated on the user's exchange of choice. It needs the ability to place orders and view account balances. These permissions will allow it to place orders and display the portfolio dashboard. We will NEVER need withdrawal permissions. That is not necessary and should NEVER be allowed on crypto bots or in general for third party websites.

EDIT 2: Just wanted to thank everyone for their feedback! I love all the issues the community has raised and totally understand the hesitancy with API keys. Thank you everyone so much for the wonderful criticism!

EDIT 3: Added website back! Please feel free to leave your feedback.

If you are in the world of cryptocurrencies or sports betting, you may be interested in the information I am going to provide below, because it is a totally disruptive project that changes the rules of the game.



This thread will be divided into 2 parts:



1.- Sports betting

2.- Cryptocurrencies



Let's start with point 1:



Currently, the bookmaker mafia limits the amounts to bet of winning players and can even go as far as closing their accounts. These abusive practices have been going on since they were created and are due to the fact that they don't want players who make them lose money, they only want losers.





1.1.- What does BetU propose to solve the limitations?



Peer to Peer betting, where each player bets against another player and the winner pays a commission to the house for using their platform.



By using this model, the limitations automatically disappear.



It is true that Betfair, Matchbook and Betdaq (traditional bookmakers) already offer these services, but BetU's commissions are lower, which means a bigger return for those bettors who focus on value bets in the long run.



2.- What else does BetU offer?



In addition to Peer to Peer, it offers the traditional bookmaker services, but with the difference that the commission applied to your odds will be the lowest in the entire European and Asian market.



For those of us who have been in this world for a long time, this fact places it above the most respectable bookmaker to date, Pinnacle (currently the bookmaker with the lowest commissions and which does not limit the winners).



3.-Why am I going to enter BetU if I have Pinnacle which offers the same?



For the simple fact that betting at Pinnacle is currently illegal in Spain and many other countries.

This is because it is an Asian bookmaker and is not one of the \~38 regulated bookmakers.



This fact means that in case you have any problems betting there directly or using an Asian broker (intermediary), you will have to eat the problem with potatoes, as the DGOJ (Dirección General de la Ordenación del Juego) is not going to do anything to help you.





Let's move on to cryptocurrencies.





4.- BetU as a token





[



Currently, the price of Betu is $0.18 and its market cap is $20 million, which makes it a high-risk currency due to its volatility but with great potential due to the following reasons:



1.- The user profile of sports betting and cryptocurrencies has a fairly high correlation, this fact produces that its adoption at the moment it is known is going to be massive.



2.- To bet you have to use the BetU token, for this reason the more people bet on this house, the higher its market price will go up.



3.- If all goes according to plan, BetU will become the best option for betting at the moment because it has no limit and the lowest commissions in the market. This fact will attract bettors from all over the world, thousands and thousands of people who are currently unaware of this project and are still at traditional bookmakers.



4.- The team is totally serious. It is currently made up of 21 people and is led by Paul Rogash, CEO of BetU, who has a lot of experience in the crypto &amp; betting market.



I attach his Linkedin: [



5.- On 21 November 2022, the World Cup in Qatar starts, which could have a big impact on the price of the token, due to the large influx of new bettors. The good thing is that right now we are 11 months away from this event and it is a very good time to take early positions for what may come.







Play to Earn game:



Tomorrow, January 4, the platform opens to place bets totally free and without risk and accumulate tokens of this project.



In order to earn this free money you have to do the following (Below is a quick example):



1.- Holder of the BetU token within this bookmaker.

2.- You will get 1% of the BetU token you are currently holding

3.- You place real bets on whatever you want to bet on

4.- The profit you make is entirely yours.



Example:



\- If you have bought $1000 of BetU, at today's price you will get \~5555 BetU tokens.

\- When you holde this amount, they will give you 1% of this 5555 to play for free (55.55).",0.057,0.852,0.092,0.988

I'm not sure how that subreddit can pretend to have any meaningful discourse while simultaneously labeling everything else in the cryptocurrency industry as a ""shitcoin"".  To me it further shows that Bitcoin investors are using more of a faith-based approach versus a pragmatic approach.**  

I'd like to outline my thesis on Bitcoin for 2022 and beyond. I have been involved in BTC for a long time and I have been very bullish on the network in the past. However, I don't believe in falling in love with an asset. I believe in constantly reviewing your thesis, since the industry and environment are highly dynamic.

So, here are my criticisms on BTC and why I think it will underperform in the short/mid term:

* Bitcoin Network lacks the maneuverability to implement changes &amp; new technology. This is for several reasons.  

   * First, the network's strength is its longevity and security. We are very careful for any modifications we make to the network as a whole, because we worry that any change could bring in a vulnerability. For that reason, BTC network is very slow to implement updates and changes tend to be very minor.
   * Second, BTC is decentralized and has no specific organization cemented as leaders. Therefore, simple changes are often disputed and have even resulted in forking the community. The creator of BTC is an anonymous person who hasn't appeared in a decade. Therefore, there is no voice of leadership, which could provide concrete direction.
   * Third, Bitcoin was of course the first network ever launched. Therefore, it is based on the most simple, albeit functional, technology. It lacks smart contract support and requires a second layer for any type of feasible scaling.
* Lightning Network has been too slow to gain adoption. Competing networks have already leapfrogged Bitcoin in terms of second layer solutions and real usage.  

   * We cannot deny that Ethereum has made big strides on their implementation of Layer 2 technology. There are multiple forms of layer 2's which are all competing and building out projects. ZK-rollups, optimistic rollups, hybrid solutions. I went to a talk on Lightning Network in 2015. Today, it's still very under-utilized.
* Blockchain Payments are better solved with stablecoins.  

   * Like it or not, BTC and other floating value cryptocurrencies are volatile. Volatility is the enemy of currency. Currency is meant to be stable, the price of an item should not change within 10 minutes of making a purchase. Commerce is still overwhelmingly done in USD and other fiat currencies. Adding a secondary currency to the mix simply complicates transactions. Further, BTC's high value creates awkward payment amounts which are difficult to understand at a quick glance. For example, it's very confusing to convert 0.000025 BTC to USD. It's much easier to convert something like 100,000 VND to USD, even though it has similarly high digits.
   * Stablecoins are quickly displacing BTC and other cryptocurrencies in payments. This trend is not showing any sign of deceleration.
   * Please spare me the inflation argument. Inflation in the USD was very low over the past decade. It is obviously much higher today, but the Fed is reacting and controlling inflation is part of their mandate. Further, 5% or even 10% inflation isn't enough to justify BTC price hitting $100K or beyond.
* Confirmations are too slow for payments  

   * Payments need to be verified near-instantaneously. It is not acceptable to wait 10+ minutes for 1 confirmation.
* BTC's primary function is as a store of value. Its value is derived from scarcity and demand. When it was the only game in town, and when it was the only project anyone was using, that was enough. However, today there are projects gaining major traction, all of which offer similar forms of scarcity. Digital scarcity is constant in some form throughout the industry. Therefore, it is not enough to warrant being the top project by itself.
* Other projects are showing up with real useful technology. DeFi seems most relevant at the moment. Blockchain gaming seems to be gaining traction as well. NFT's are very hype-y but long term, their application outside the art world has great potential. BTC has no way to really get involved with these new use cases. It is pigeon holed into payments / single asset network.

So there you have it. I'm sure you'll be tempted to tell me I'm an asshole, since you are probably a BTC investor. But I'd really love to hear your critical responses to my concerns. I would love to see Bitcoin succeed and continue to dominate the market. I just don't see how to get excited about the project as it is today, especially compared to its peers.",0.046,0.838,0.116,0.9952

Crypto Markets (And Traditional Markets) Fall on a Hawkish Fed
On Wednesday at 2 PM, the Federal Reserve released the minutes from its December FOMC meeting. In the minutes, there appeared an alarming consensus that the Fed should begin raising rates and shrinking the balance sheet as soon as possible once its taper is completed as anticipated in March 2022. This degree of hawkishness had already been communicated by the Fed in several forms, and so it is perhaps surprising that investors had a strong reaction to the news. Fed dot plots from that December meeting, released immediately after the meeting, showed an anticipated three rate hikes in 2022. Fed Governor Christopher Waller said in a speech soon after the December meeting that balance sheet reduction could start in 2022. But if the information was not entirely new, investors were perhaps caught off guard by the forcefulness and level of consensus shown in the minutes. What's for certain is that investors quickly reacted, sending many traditional financial markets, as well as crypto, down.

There did not appear to be any fundamental news in the crypto space and liquidations, while elevated, were not notable. We have written extensively in recent months about the increasing relationship between crypto and traditional markets, and so we will be keeping a close eye on the actions of the Federal Reserve going forward. The next FOMC meeting is January 25th - 26th and the next CPI reading is January 12th.
 
Hash Rates Fall Amid Kazakhstan Internet Shutdown
In recent days, Kazakhstan has faced significant protests, sparked by the government’s decision to lift price caps on fuel amid energy shortages, leading to significant price increases. Attempting to tame the protests, the government shut down the internet. In the wake of China’s ban on mining, a number of Chinese miners crossed the border into Kazakhstan. Prior to the protests, the nation controlled nearly 20% of the world’s hash rate. Since bitcoin mining requires internet access to download blocks and transactions and propagate new blocks, this effectively shut down mining in the country. With the internet still down, this provides a boon to miners outside of the country who are now more likely to win blocks and collect rewards.
 
Despite bitcoin being a supranational currency, operations that support the network still occur within national boundaries. Miners need energy, internet, and government approval to operate, and the continued provision of these interrelated needs can be suddenly stopped in nations that lack stability. When miners left China, we believe that this improved the stability of the long-term Bitcoin network (as well as its environmental profile). If miners were to leave Kazakhstan to freer and steadier nations following the latest conflagration, it would likely have a similar impact. The episode also reinforced how vital it is that network hash rate is globally distributed rather than concentrated and exposed to the whims of a few governments.
 
Custody is Still the Top Institutional Investor Concern
This week, a survey from crypto asset manager Nickel Digital Asset Management highlighted the chief concern of institutional investors in the space, asset custody. The survey, reported in the media, said that 79% of respondents representing $108.4B in assets under management cited secure storage of digital assets as the key consideration whether to invest in the space. Our conversations with investors new to the industry echo similar concerns, which stem from the core nature of Bitcoin itself. Bitcoin is technology that removes trust from a central entity and places it in the hands of the network participants: miners, node operators, and those that own bitcoin. Bitcoin has been called a “digital bearer instrument”, which to us means that whoever possesses the private key, the password that allows one to move bitcoins, has the right to the asset itself. Given this technological innovation, it should come as no surprise that institutional investors are concerned with the safeguarding of their private keys. While counterparty risks exist in the traditional markets, something that was on full display during the Global Financial Crisis, losing your securities or having them stolen is not a threat historically borne by traditional market investors. We understand the concern and therefore encourage those entering the space to perform adequate due diligence on service providers. It is just as important as the investment analysis itself.

01/07/22,"Thoughts? I'm really looking for bull-thesis to support the idea we hold the line around $41K. But I just ... am getting more pessimistic based on my results below.

BTC is mirroring the change in real rate yields of 10-year bonds. The 10 year negative rate rose from -1.17 to -0.73 and BTC fell from \~68,000 to $41,800 so far....an almost exact match of about 37.6% and 38% respectively. 10-year nominal rates are expected to reach 2% to 2.25% which - while inflation remains high (assuming it doesn't change at all) will put the real rate yields near -0.49 to -0.24.  Worst case scenario that we can predict is -1.17 to -0.24 or about 20.5% meaning BTC can reach $13,940 down from $68,000. 

I ran the numbers for February 2021 lowest rate and March 2021 highest rate, and correlated it to the drop in price as well.

Real rate yields changed 53.7% and BTC changed 48.1%.

I don't know why the timing was skewed but I figured it might have to do with massive FOMO and retailers and exuberance.

03/18/22,"I figured I would do an update on my ongoing crypto audit.  **This is long.**

This applies ONLY to the US.

Disclaimer:

This is MY Experience.  No doubt there are others who know better.  This is advice from someone who really fucked up and is paying dearly for that.  Don't be ME.  Crypto was new in 2017.  I did a lot of poorly though out and kind of ""reckless beyond sense"" things with bitcoin, Etherium, ICOs and every other shitcoin available at the time.

**The TL/DR is, you better have ALL of your details.  Going back to your first trade.  You are NOT smarter than the IRS.**

\-------------------

 Some quick background: 

This audit is on my 2017 taxes.  I received a request for back-up information that was due on August 26th 2019.  I went through my records and reconstructed everything I could find.  I knew i was missing some...but I did not think it would matter.  Silly me.

Of course I waited until the last minute to do the work.  I had a couple other things on my mind.

It just so happened that August 26 was the day of my wife's Whipple Surgery for pancreatic cancer and it was the day my mom died after being in hospice for 3 weeks.  Literally, the worst day of my life.

Needless to say, I ""effed"" up the reply and that triggered a real anal probe of a review.  My review indicated I should get a 5 figure refund.  And they paid it. 

Then, they looked closer.  Boy...was I wrong.

 The amount of detail they have gone into over the past two year has been amazing.  I discovered I was using incorrect thinking about cost basis.  And when I realized that, I knew I was screwed. 

 I have been fully cooperating--which is good because they are going to be quick to play the ""evasion"" card.  I actually paid a big bill going into the review to acknowledge I screwed up.  They got paid back their refund...and then a lot.

 They went through every transaction on my Coinbase, Trezor, [Gate.io] Bittrex, and a couple of MEW wallets.  Ever.  From the first day I traded bitcoin in May 2013. 

Every move, every buy, every sale.  Now, keep in mind we are talking the big run of 2017, BCH drops, ETH trades and a bunch of ICOs.  There are about 1400 transactions, but then you need to account for every move OUT of one wallet to another.  If you can tie them together, there is no impact.  But if you sent stuff out to other addresses and you cannot identify it and establish where it was...its a sale.

 So, here is how its going.  After two years and some pretty intense discussions (all of it amicable), it has come to pass that the IRS has engaged a third party vendor they use to calculate cost basis and capital gains.  This third party will take the ledger files of all of your wallets and combine them into a single transaction list.  They will calculate your cost basis and taxable income.  The IRS will present this to me.  Then we can ""discuss.""

 Now, here are some important things to note:  I had two Bitcoin Q wallets (large and small.) at the very start of my BTC life.  One I called the ""large"" wallet.  The other the small wallet.  One had a couple of large deposits from bulk buys and sales.  Not a big deal.  I actually had those records.  It took a week to download the blockchain...but I ended up with the detail.

The ""small"" wallet had hundreds of small transactions.  When I got my trezor, I moved everything to the trezor and never gave this ""small"" wallet any thought.  It now sits on a broken hard drive or lost USB drive.  I've torn my home apart looking for it.  That stupid little wallet is going to be the death of me.  There are no coins in the wallet, but there ARE hundreds of transfers all around to and from the wallet that I cannot ""prove.""

Obviously, tying a sale to a specific purchase is easy.  You subtract one from the other...and the difference is your gain or loss.  Easy Peasy.  Just make sure you can do that and account for every single move you have every made in your crypto life.

**Every time I sent something out of the wallet and I cannot tie to a real sale, or an exchange for good (like a financial Report) is considered a sale.** That taxable income is based on the cost basis--and these little sales will change every cost basis from 2016 to 2022.  It screws up thousands of transactions. 

**Every time you get bitcoin or any other crypto coming into your account and you cannot account for the purchase, it is assumed that the income crypto is INCOME.**  And that is the cost of the unit for your cost basis.

Those two things added up to tens of thousands in ""capital gains"" AND ""income"" they say haven't been reported.  We've whittled away at that number....but its still bigger than I want it to be.

Throughout the process I have been asked such ""rookie"" questions such as, ""When you move crypto from wallet to wallet in a Trezor, do you pay a commission or pay a network fee?""  Scary, huh?

My point is that some of the people you will be dealing with have little or no experience with this process.  Years ago I was audited for a small business and at least the examiner and I ""spoke"" the same language--we might have have disagreed, but at least I understood where he was coming from--and he knew what I was saying.  No so with Crypto.  They have specialists who are always in training.  Listen to what they asking to verify that its even ""correct.""  My examiner and I actually had some laughs over their ""crypto ignorance.""

Its like laughing with the Lion about to eat you.

 So...these guys are backed up against the wall.  I signed two extensions--some lasting a year because they were backed up with cases.  And these are the examiners--not the folks doing to tax return back ups. 

Part of this is because they NEED to give you six months after your findings to appeal.  And you need at least a full year of ""active examination"" for the appeal to proceed.  They don’t have the staff and they don’t have the time to do this stuff swiftly. 

The downside to that is if they are up against the wall, they will go with their first blush—and that was really, really wrong.

 Since I know I am screwed, and I paid more of what I am going to owe...I signed.  And now this can go until Dec 2022. 

 But, my advice for everyone is to do the following:

**Its not what you know, or think about what you did...its about what you can prove.**

 Print out the account report for ALL of your exchanges.  All of your exchanges going back to your first transaction.  Put them in a safe place.

 Print out the history of each of your wallets.  Even if you think no one will ever find it.  They will.

 List out everything you've bought with bitcoin.  Because that purchase price is going to be a sale.  If you sent it to an address...they are going to identify that address.  When I did my report I just said I bought ""gold"" or financial reports with it.  The gold I have receipts for.  The financial reports...not so much.  They haven't pressed me on  that stuff because they were minor.

 The ICOs bought were a pain in the ass because a lot of them were on MetaMask and it would take a fortune to go back rebuild those.  I kept pretty good records of the follow on sales, so that won't be horrible.  But I would have loved to have the records.

 If you did any kiosk and peer to peer exchanges, they will want the details.  Names, Dates, etc.

As best you can, tie one transaction to the next in a daisy chain.  They understand network fees so if you can show you sent 2 of this to a wallet, and then sent it to another wallet..they understand that.  But you have to be able to tie them together and prove it.  This is tough when you aggregate in an off line wallet, and then send them to a single address to sell.

If you did a lot of trading (say on Coinbase and Robinhood) it can be maddening.

 **Do no lie to them.   Never use NEVER or ALWAYS when describing anything to them.**

**Do not ignore their letters.  They don't ""ask"" multiple times.  They will write a couple of times.  Then it will come certified mail.  Then they will toss a lien on your bank account and house.  (THAT did not happen, but I've heard stories.)**

I cannot tell you how many times I've told them, ""I think that's it""...and then i found a place where I did four or five ""one-off"" transactions that cleared up about $6k in taxable transactions (which was good.)  But, I had to go back and say, ""look what I found.""  On a couple occasions they've come back and said, ""What was this...we cannot find it anywhere else.  It looks like it went to ‘”Fill in the blank exchange.”  And there I am standing with my pants down.  I had no memory of making that transaction 5 years ago.

 If  you are using a third party vendor to assess transactions, make sure you include ALL of your wallets and all moves, transfers, and transactions since Day 1.  Do not assume if you are using a Trezor for some stuff, a Ledger for another, and Coinbase for other stuff that simply linking your API to Coinbase is going to be good enough.  Its not.  They want it all.

Even though their examination will be for a specific year...they will ask to see cost basis.  In my case they cannot go back further to taxable income because the statute time has lapsed.  But, the ""cost basis"" they come up with will affect hundreds of transactions from 2017 through 2022.

They will expect a ""re-file"" of transactions for those tax years.  Even this year, their finding will likely impact the cost basis for some crypto traded in 2021.  This means I get an extension now or I will literally have to refile in May or June.

 The tiny good news is that during this process I found residual tidbits of ETH and Bitcoin in a few small wallets.  Was amounted to $5 in 2017 is considerably more today.  So I was able to pick up a couple hundred dollars. LOL

 The process has been frustrating, maddening, and enlightening.  The examining agent and I have become ""friendly.""  They are wonderful people working for an entirely inept bureaucracy.  While I have gotten my digs in here and there, I guess I have been worn down to being a compliant worker bee.

**You are not smarter than the IRS.  If you watched Ozark and think you can move money around in the US without them seeing it or finding it...you are wrong.  Don't try doing that.**

**Don't lie.  If you are in this situation, suck it up and deal with them.  Get help if you need it.  DO. NOT.LIE.**

 They will come at you…not this year, but in 1 to 2 years or later.  They are that backed up.  They will ask for a whole range of detail.  If you do not provide it, with cross references or updates, they will nail you.  That is where it becomes scary.

 If anyone lives in the US and they find you have done any dealing in Crypto and you do not “check the box” on the Tax form they will come down hard on you.  Don’t do that.  They told me that is the first thing they will cross reference.

So, after two years I've finally submitted every note, spreadsheet, download, or report that I can find displaying my crypto history.  There are no more Merlin Cryto secrets.  They have it all.  Its up to their Wizards.

They will come back with a number that I can negotiate, dispute, or appeal.  I am pretty sure I won't have the money or inclination to fight this further.  I can pay their fine, get Jussie'd out of ""IRS jail"" and get on with my life.  When someone in your family has PC, you do not dwell on shit.  Even when its been gone for two years.

 The only thing that makes me smile is the knowledge that somewhere there are a bunch of college kids who made $50k in Dogecoin last year.  Or Shiba.  And they either blew it on Spring Break or they tried to hide it (They watch too much Ozark.). And these kids are going to have to claim that revenue on their Taxes, their parent’s taxes, and their FAFSA.  Financial Aid will get dropped.  And parents will be on the hook for their kids taxes…AND their own modest tax rate could get bumped up to another rate.  

That might be fun to watch as I emerge on the other end of the IRS colon

My best advice is be very careful.  Be honest.  And be prepared to show you work...just like a 7th grade algebra test.

If you have any questions, let me know.  I will do my best to answer them.  But...every case is different.",0.064,0.852,0.084,0.9949

On-chain data shows Bitcoin selling on the crypto exchange Binance has started to weaken in recent weeks as outflows have shot up.

## Binance Has Observed Negative Bitcoin Netflows Recently

As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the world’s largest crypto exchange by trading volume, Binance, has seen a decline in BTC dumping recently.

The “netflow” is an indicator that tells us about the net amount of Bitcoin entering or exiting wallets of an exchange.

The value of this metric is calculated by simply taking the difference between the inflows and the outflows for the exchange in question.

When the netflow registers a positive value, it means inflows are currently dominating the outflows. Such a trend may be bearish for the price of Bitcoin as holders usually deposit their crypto to exchanges for selling purposes.

On the other hand, positive values of the indicator imply investors are taking out a net amount of coins at the moment. This kind of trend can be bullish for the crypto’s price as it may be a sign of accumulation.

04/14/22," You’ve probably heard claims like “Bitcoin mining consumes more energy than all of Argentina” or “Bitcoin mining uses more energy than all of Google operations”. Claims that will earn the raising of eyebrows, but fail to address the fundamental question is the environmental impact of Bitcoin mining is worth the benefits? This question should be broken down into two aspects: energy consumption and hardware churn.

The energy used by Bitcoin miners does three powerful things:

**Energy consumption**

1.Secures all the wealth stored on the Bitcoin network in a decentralized state.

Most current financial systems are controlled by a centralized entity, banks, credit unions, federal reserve, etc. This means that those central parties can manipulate funds, stop transactions or do whatever they feel is in the “best interest” of whatever source of power is pushing them to act. For example, Canada recently confiscated funds that were donated to a protesting group they did not agree with. Banks, credit unions, GoFundMe, and many other entities were asked to freeze accounts, stop payments or take action in some way to prevent funding the protesters. Because Bitcoin has no single point of control, flexing this level of power is not possible whether you’re an individual or a sovereign nation.

2.Creates a financial incentive that promotes renewable energy sources

Bitcoin mining has become a profitable industry for many companies. One major expense mining companies face is energy costs. What is the cheapest energy long-term? You guessed it, renewables. There is a built-in financial incentive to acquire the cheapest energy for these “for-profit” companies which means every mining company will seek out integrating renewable energies as part of their operational setup. With greater demand for renewables, renewable companies will allocate more funds for research and development to improve wind, solar, and hydro technologies to better fulfill the added market demand. Coming full circle, Bitcoin mining is not only promoting the adoption but also the improvement of renewable energy technology.

3.Provides stability to unstable power grids

An interesting aspect of Bitcoin mining is the ability for miners to be turned on or off ad hoc without affecting operational infrastructure, unlike cement, steel, or any other industrial entity. Because of this, we are seeing grid operators partnering with mining facilities to best make use of the energy grids. In Texas, there was a recent overload on the power grid when a freeze came through and every household had to turn off their heater. With the amount of energy needed to sustain every business and household, the energy grid was at a near collapse and rolling blackouts were pushed to keep the grid intact. Since the freeze, the grid has been expanding with added renewables and with miners leveraging much of the “excess” or unused energy. In the event of another freeze where the household energy consumption is expected to spike, the energy companies would pay the mining companies to turn off a portion of their Bitcoin miners to free up the needed energy supply to the grid. Once the household load subsides, the Bitcoin miners can be turned back on utilizing the freed-up “excess” energy.

**Hardware Churn**

The physical lifespan of a current ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit) miner is between 2-3 years. Financial lifespan will have a broader range depending on multiple factors such as cost of energy usage, when the miner comes online, the hash rate growth of the network, and what the Bitcoin price does during the miner’s lifespan. 

Another factor that’s had a significant impact on mining is the rate at which hardware technology has evolved, specifically for ASIC miners. As soon as a new miner is released, there is a stronger and more efficient miner right around the corner. This has led to a lot of churn with large-scale mining operations quickly retiring old miners and replacing them with new ones.

Given that Bitcoin mining is still relatively new, especially from a commercialization view, mining technology is evolving at a rapid rate which means if you are in the business of mining for profit, you’ll likely continue purchasing the new mining rigs to keep your financial returns competitive with your peers. This leaves many “older” mining rigs in a position of no man’s land where they can’t return profits worth their operational costs and they can’t be re-purposed for any other use.

I believe this is the most valid critique of Bitcoin mining but one that can hopefully be addressed in the near future. There have been a few ideas floating around, such as integrating retired miners with new home energy builds to help offset energy costs while maintaining the Bitcoin network or building miners in a way where once they are decommissioned, they can be better stripped to have their components re-purposed. Either way, hardware churn is a top concern of the Bitcoin community and is likely to be addressed as more hardware manufacturers enter the space.

**In Summary**

*Bitcoin mining is a waste of energy*

This critique is COMPLICATED - On one hand, the energy Bitcoin consumes is used to secure all of the stored wealth in a decentralized state, provides stability to power grids, and promote renewable energy development and implementation. On the other hand, the physical miners are often replaced frequently with no real repurposable utility for the retired miners.",0.052,0.745,0.203,0.9993

04/17/22,"Only a black-swan event, according to PlanB, the author of the bitcoin Stock-to-Flow (S2F) model, could bring Bitcoin's price down below $24,500. Although the anonymous Twitter alias has been known to miss Bitcoin price predictions in the past, he remains enthusiastic on the commodity, predicting that it would reach $100K by the end of the year.

The bitcoin analyst with over 1.7 million followers on Twitter said in a tweet  that he doesn’t see a reason that would bring bitcoin’s price down to its current realized price (average cost price) at $24.5K. He also noted that there were only three times that such a capitulation occurred in history.

 • Bitcoin SV (BSV) forking in 2018, Bitstamp, and Mt. Gox being respectively hacked in 2014 and 2011 were incidents – in PlanB’s view – that pushed BTC down below its realized price level

Willy Woo, another well-known Bitcoin expert, disagrees that BSV forking was to blame for Bitcoin's steep price slide below important support levels in 2018; instead, he feels the ""effect of whale control of BitMEX perps at full scale"" was to blame. 
BitMEX was one of the most well-known cryptocurrency exchanges in the world when it was founded in 2014. It became the most popular derivatives product at one point with the launch of ""perpetual futures"" in 2016, which were designed to entice traders interested in leverage trading. 

Despite the fact that PlanB's previous prognosis of Bitcoin hitting over $100K in 2021 failed to materialize, according to his ""floor model,"" the analyst predicted in February that BTC would achieve a six-digit price before the end of the year.

Despite the fact that PlanB's previous prognosis of Bitcoin hitting over $100K in 2021 failed to materialize, the analyst predicted in February that BTC will reach a six-digit price tag by the end of 2023 using both the S2F and the logarithmic regression.

04/17/22,"We constantly see news of multibillion-dollar corporations purchasing cryptocurrencies in massive amounts, mostly BTC but many others as well.

Just this month, Luna Foundation Guard bought thousands of BTC, and they have a total of over 40,000 bitcoins.

Microstrategy holds about 125,000 BTC, valued at over $5.8 billion.

Certainly, institutional interest in crypto is just a part of mass adoption. It is unavoidable that large corporations and institutions will fiddle where the money is; there's no way around it. However, this has me wondering, what about the average Joe?

The retail investors that have an actual interest in cryptocurrencies, those that believe in the technology and want to utilize it for its intended purpose; i.e. BTC as a decentralized store of value and payment currency, don't have millions to purchase BTC like institutions.

As institutions hold billions in BTC, it keeps the buying pressure up, but what if they sell and it causes a large dip in BTC? Institutions can manipulate the market however they want, causing retail to panic sell and then buy back BTC at a lower price. And as BTC falls, other projects that have good fundamentals like Plastiks or Link, they will fall too. And these institutions also include CEXs like Coinbase, Binance, FTX, etc that can see your orders.

Theoretically, a billionaire corporation can buy billions worth of BTC, driving the price up and leaving less supply for the entire world.

In short, institutional interest in crypto is a part of mass adoption, but it will almost certainly negatively impact the average investor that's in cryptos for the technology.",0.043,0.8,0.157,0.9858

04/21/22,"Hi Everyone! Bitcoin’s been catching a lot of heat lately over its energy consumption. Article after article comes out that decry its harm to the environment. 

But the truth is far more comforting than a handful of seemingly harsh data points about Bitcoin and the environment. I wanted to create this post to equip every miner and Bitcoiner with the arguments they need to spread the truth about Bitcoin’s impact on the environment.

How could such an energy-consuming technology benefit the Green Movement?

In short, there’s more to Bitcoin than its critics appreciate.

**Bitcoin mining renders renewable energy sources viable.** 

In April 2021, Jack Dorsey’s Square released a white paper boldly titled, “Bitcoin is Key to an Abundant, Clean Energy Future”. Early in the memo, the authors explained that the costs for solar and wind energy have recently dropped by 90% and 71%, respectively. Suffice to say that green alternatives are rapidly gaining steam on the cost side of the ledger.

But as explained above, it’s difficult to match supply of solar and wind energy to demand. Demand for energy peaks in the early evening, when people are home and using appliances. At that time, though, the sun is already setting, and wind is always unpredictable.

**Enter Bitcoin mining**

Miners can work from anywhere, so long as they’re connected to a power source and the internet. Because of this, they can act as ‘an energy buyer of last resort’: whenever supply of wind or solar exceeds demand, miners can jump in and pay for the privilege of using the energy to mine Bitcoin. This will render renewable energy far more profitable, and will therefore incentivize the creation of *more* green energy sources.

Square’s white paper puts it succinctly: “Bitcoin miners…offer highly flexible and easily interruptible load…and are completely location agnostic, requiring only an internet connection. \[They are\] an energy buyer of last resort that can be turned on or off at a moment’s notice anywhere in the world.”

**Bitcoin is one of the cleanest industries on the planet**

In 2021, the Bitcoin Mining Council (BMC) published the results of a voluntary survey that investigated the electricity consumption and sustainable power mix of about one-third of the Bitcoin network. They discovered that those surveyed used electricity fed by 67% sustainable power. The surveyors inferred that the entire Bitcoin network’s sustainable electricity mix had increased to 56%, making it among the greenest industries in the world.

In contrast, electricity in the United States is only 30.5% sustainable, and electricity in China is less than 15% sustainable. 

**Bitcoin mining employs energy that would’ve otherwise gone to waste**

As Caitlin Long, CEO of Avanti Financial Group, said in a recent documentary, “More than 2/3 of the energy produced in the world is waste energy, because it’s produced during the hours of the day when there’s not demand to consume it…it’s also produced in a place where there’s not transmission to move it across space and time, and so that energy goes unused and wasted.” 

Crusoe Energy and others are tackling this issue with bitcoin Mining. The company raised 128 million dollars in 2021 to build data centers and Bitcoin mining operations that use this wasted energy and reduce methane emissions.

Crusoe Energy operates out of North Dakota, where 500 million cubic feet of gas are flared daily. The company runs forty data centers that harness flared natural gas as of 2021. Soon, they expect to operate 100 units across six states.  

Co-founder of Crusoe Energy, Lochmiller, said that “Where we view our power consumption, we draw a very clear line in our project evaluation stage where we’re reducing emissions for…oil and gas projects.”

**Energy consumption drives progress and so doesn’t require defending**

Professor Vaclav Smil’s *Energy and Civilization: A History* traces the relationship between energy consumption and human progress. To take one example, he explains that a typical 1900 Great Plains farmer employed at most 5 kilowatts of power to plow his field using horses. In 2000, a farmer couple can employ over 250 kilowatts of power with a diesel engine, all while “sitting high above the ground in the air-conditioned comfort of his tractor cabin.”

Smil’s thesis aligns with our common sense. There is a reason that modern cities consume more energy than ancient villages, that airplanes consume more energy than horses, and that calculators consume more energy than abacuses. Seen in this light, even *if* Bitcoin was the most energy-intensive money ever invented, that does not mean that we should continue using gold and fiat currencies. A more comprehensive comparison should compare all of the costs *and* benefits conferred on humanity by each money. 

To critics of Bitcoin who appeal to its energy consumption, I ask: why is environmental impact the standard by which you judge an innovation, rather than the benefit said innovation would confer on humanity? 

If you are interested in ways of pushing this movement and have more questions regarding changing the current paradigm around Bitcoin mining and the environment, Sazmining, a renewable energy Bitcoin mining venture, is hosting an [AMA] today at 1 pm ET. Their AMAs are super interesting to listen to, and they love to get questions from fellow miners and Bitcoiners.",0.039,0.779,0.182,0.9992

Dovish FOMC meeting was recent  


The Max Pain sits at 40k, 4k above price. Price tends to move towards max pain rather than away from it, so it will tend to move upwards.  


Twitter sentiment is still EXTREMELY bearish (even more so than earlier), which rather than ignition sends a signal of the bearish trend's exhaustion.  


All of the long liquidations have taken place already, and this tend to lead to a reversal.  


Insider stock traders have MASSIVELY slowed their selling down, and are in fact buying the dip!

05/20/22," Preface: Harmless narrative on general assumptions from being obsessed with BTC. Just adding some opinions to the discourse. Read at your own risk.


The volume we've seen drive down the BTC price is largely institutional traders treating BTC as a speculative asset to make a quick buck in a low interest environment. They quickly dumped their coins in an escape to fiat. The consequence of this dump scared new retailers into selling their coins.

However, I imagine the institutions are surprised BTC's price hasn't fallen further. The legion of long term holders that never sell and continue to accumulate is at an all time high. This army of plebs is supporting the price and is unlikely to capitulate under any circumstance (almost).

What we're all waiting for is the next leg down after a big dump by whales. This could be the final catalyst before finding the floor. I'm not well versed to the impact from leveraged long and short traders but I've read longs are piling in at record levels. The cascading effect of these liquidations may also be a force to drive price down.

Give it a few months and I believe we'll reach the absolute bottom. My prediction is we'll see $19-22k. This will be the load zone for whales and wall street to re-enter. It may also be the point that some diamond hands show they are not quite strong as presumed. I hope not but the fear it's going to $6k will shake some. Don't fall into this category! Don't be the sell side of the whale buying!

Simultaneous to this price movement, we have layer 2 applications being rapidly developed by top tier teams and individuals. Additionally, we have regulations and revised accounting standards close to being deployed. The stage will be perfectly set for new explosive growth and price movement. By the end of 2022, the price will have recovered to $45k.

With the stage set and the macro economy stabilizing, a new tidal wave of money will enter the space. This wave will crash everyone's expectations and usher in the next era of BTC. We will quickly see the price rise above $100k by the end of 2023. This momentum's effect on price will strengthen with the aide of the next halving. We will never see another 70% drawdown on BTC's price. We'll reach the $100k+ level and start to stabilize - waiting for the next era that will be even more exciting. I think we'll eventually see $180k in this period.

Anyone that buys now at $30k, will 3-6X their investment by 2024. Anyone that buys at $18-22k will 6-9X their investment. Anyone that ultimately capitulates at $19k, will buy back at $45k.

05/25/22,"I've decided to post this investigation on here since many new traders on the daily thread tend to trade support setups. I think some of you may find this useful. 

[

This is an example of an auto-generated trendline from the algorithm.

I was doing an investigation into support trendlines. Particular  automated generation of trend lines and gathering statistics on retests,  angles and expected RoI. This example was selected due to the simplicity of 2D geometry: y = mx +  c. More complex formations may require feature points detection + a  classification algorithm  such as Support-Vector machines, Recursive Neural Networks or K-means  clustering. 

Fitting trendlines automatically will allow us to gather statistics on price action and trendline retests. 

The assumptions for trend line creation...  

* (1) Trendline is formed by two daily lows. 
* (2) The trendline must not have any intercepting lows between the two candidates for selecting a trendline 
* (3) An intercept is considered intercepting the trend line  when the trendline residual is &lt; the interpolated position on the  trendline +1%

The assumptions for retest are...

* (1) The residual is within +/- 1% of the interpolated position on the trendline. 

The assumptions for breakdown of a support line is...

* (1) The residual is &lt; 1% of the interpolated position on the trendline. 

I gathered various data on price action such as the number of retests  before breakdown, the angle of the trend line, the length of time from  retest to local high,  the median/mean delta from trendline to market high, the length of time a  trendline is active, the size of trendline clusters, the volume traded  at the trendline, etc.  In a detailed investigation, I may use eigenvalue decomposition to  identify the metrics with the highest statistical distribution. Usually  these will contain the  most information about the model constructed. However, in this study, I  just look at the number of retest and angle as an example of how to find  statistical edges.  

The mean sample size for trendlines per ticker is \~300. This gives us a margin-of-error of +/- 5% with 95% confidence.   

We will define statistical edges as an expectancy above 0. We will calculate expectancy as  

**strike rate \* expected return - (1 - strike rate) \* stop**

[**

Example of probability of breakdown per retest for a single ticker.

The first interesting stats are the probability of breaking down a  support line does not change with the number of retests. It is always a  favourable 75%. Likewise  the median RoI is also a consistent 9-12% for all retests. Note:  Outliers were removed from the sampleset before computing these  statistics (2.968σ). 

**(0.25)\*9 - (0.75)\*2 = 2.25 - 1.5 = 0.75 before commission and slippage.**

No edge. The breakdown statistic was also consistent with trendline  angle. Since our strike rate is fixed, we may be able to increase our  edge by maximising our  expected returns.  

[

Modelled trend line residual as % change relative to trend line price at time t, for varying support line angles.

Unfortuantely our sample size for angle bins is considerably lower,  so we will have to increase our samplesize to get more meaningful  results, but this is adequete  enough for an explanation.  

This is quite  interesting as previously discrestionary traders  claimed trendline breakdowns are more violent when the angle is lower.  Though we dont gather stats  on the velocity of breakdowns, we can see that our retest long positions  will have an increased return on investments for negative gradient  trendlines, i.e.,  retests in a bear market or retesting market corrections in a bull  market.  

A factor of 3 increase would put our new edge at... 

**(0.25)\*27 - (0.75)\*2 = 6.75 - 1.5 = 5.25 before commission and slippage.** 

Considerably higher! It's amazing how statistical analysis can skew  the probability gods in our favour. Alternatively we may be able to  achieve a higher strike rate by focusing on trading the breakdown rather  than the retest.  

So ignoring trading a breakdown, we can setup a potential strategy for backtesting... 

* (1) Enter @ 1% above support line of negative gradient 
* (2) Tight stop @ 1% below support line  
* (3) Exit @ median or after 2 days (median time to top).

We can go a step further by creating a cumulative distribution for  the sample set to calculate the proability of RoI... but leave the fight  for another day.  

Don't forget to split your test and training datasets during backtests and use a Monte Carlo to simulate all market conditions! 

Hopefully this can provide some guidance on how to use investigations  to identify statistical edges in the market for exploitation.",0.053,0.868,0.08,0.9312

Saylor has spent about $3.9 billion buying bitcoin and at Bitcoin' current price of about $29,000, Saylor is estimated to have lost about $240 million… but he isn't one bit bothered.

Although strange, Saylor believes that one BTC will one day be worth millions of dollars and so even with BTC plunge from around $68k to current $29k, Saylor says trading isn't an option he's considering anytime soon.

Combined with bitcoin' price plunge, bitcoin network Proof-of-work validation mechanism has faced massive criticism due Its environmental impact when compared to Proof-of-stake networks like Zetrix and Solana which are more environmentally friendly.

So Saylor mentions the likes of Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg and Larry Page, who earned their billions by building a real product and not by trading.

Yeah, Saylor could be right about hodling being more profitable when compared to day trading, but how easy is it to Hodl bitcoin knowing you are already in loss??",0.066,0.8,0.134,0.9396

05/29/22,"The market is definitely in a bear season, and the price of major cryptocurrencies, especially bitcoin proves this without any doubt.

According to a market analysis available here

  

Currently, the price of bitcoin is likely to close the weekly chart in the red, making it the 9th consecutive close in red; and right now, BTC’s price is trading at around $29,000 – which implies a 0.6% rise on the 24 hour candle but a 1.3% fall on the weekly candle.

It has also been seven days full of sideways actions and slow declines for bitcoin and this is coming amidst several concerns about Bitcoin' huge carbon footprint when compared to other environmentally-friendly blockchain networks like Solana, Zetrix and BNBChain which utilizes the Proof-of-stake consensus model.

Michael Saylor has however said that he isn't bothered one bit about Bitcoin' plunge as he believes that one bitcoin would someday be worth a million dollars.

So a 9th weekly candle is most likely closing in another red for bitcoin, what's your forecast for the coming week?

Lately, I see people attacking Bitcoin because “since Bitcoin\`s price is clearly correlated with the centralized economy (FED rates, wars, fiscal policy, economic cycles, and so on) then Bitcoin is not a decentralized alternative to the current economic system, it all the same thing”. In other words, Bitcoin failed its purpose, and it's no different than traditional assets like stocks or bonds.

I understand the logic behind all of this, Bitcoin was in theory created as a response to the 2008 economic crisis so its price being correlated with the centralized economic system may be interpreted as a failure or even irony. In my opinion, that's bullshit for many reasons, but the simpler explanation is we (Bitcoin enthusiasts) just don't live in a vacuum.

The centralized economy will dictate how much money we can afford to hold, for example, if your company is firing people or reducing your hours you probably need to sell some of your holdings, and/or you won't be able to keep accumulating at the same rate you did in the past. The centralized economy will also dictate miners' profits and investment, because of utility costs, taxes, financial expenses, and so on. That's common sense 101!

I know Bitcoin looks like a giant but compared with other assets it's pretty small, for example, Bitcoin´s fully diluted market cap is way lower than Tesla´s market cap. It's incredibly stupid to believe the “real” economy would somehow not affect Bitcoin in the medium and short term, we are a small thing and we have no power to fight the friking economic system.

Of course, the long-term objective is to create a decentralized economy, and the Bitcoin price will at some point be independent of any kind of centralized forces. But this will take decades and that's in fact a great opportunity because we all know Bitcoin was designed to reward adopters (the earliest the better).

The fact Bitcoin is NOT an “uncorrelated asset” right now shouldn't be seen as a failure to serve its original purpose but as a huge incentive to keep holding and accumulating hoping we will --at some point-- be able to achieve this and make a nice profit in the process. Just reaching gold´s market cap (a reasonable medium-term objective IMAO) would mean a 20x from now, the power of holding is crazy.

06/10/22,"So I built a stash of BTC I'm planning on holding on for the long term (years and years). Is there any reason why I shouldn't trade it for a stack of GBTC instead? My thesis is:

1. GBTC will eventually be converted to an ETF, eliminating the current \~30% discount to NAV and netting a large gain vs holding plain BTC.
2. I have stable income and other assets, so I'm unlikely to be forced to sell this position early before the above happens.
3. The risk that Grayscale exit scams or otherwise looses their coins is extremely small.

The only risk I can see is that somehow they fail to convert to an ETF forever and I'm stuck eating the 2% annual fee. However, at the current \~30% discount, this has to go on for like 15 years before I start taking a loss.

From the third bull run, the ratio between the Dec2017 high and the Jan2015 low is 19764.51 / 163.88 = 120.6.

From the fourth bull run, the ratio between the Nov2021 high and the Dec2018 low is 68944.62 / 3148.33 = 21.9.



The second derivatives, then:

The ratio of the returns of the second bull run to the third bull run: 585.67 / 120.6 = 4.86.

The ratio of the returns of the third bull run to the fourth bull run: 120.6 / 21.9 = 5.51.

So I am trying to build a repository of free/useful tools for the crypto community on my website. 

My idea for this week is to build a realtime view of arbitrage opportunities across exchanges. Of course the vision sounds cool to me but what matters most is your feedback if you will use it or not.

Goal: Give a somewhat realtime look into arbitrage opportunities in crypto on one page. It isn't meant to be a signal or anything super fancy (does that make this completely useless?)

Current state: [

Question? What simple features should I focus on for the next few days. My current thoughts:

i) Include more assets / trading pairs

ii) Include a way to select two exchanges at a time. Right now I have CB and Binance but if you could use a dropdown and select Binance and Bitstamp for example.

iii) Style the table with colors to know when something is going up and down.

iv) Incorporate exchange rate data (I have access to it but not sure how to make it digestible).

I want to get this to a decent state and just leave it out there soon -- am I on the right track? Is this a dashboard you would use (again completely free).

I posted about this in the daily and feedback so far:

\- Incorporate Web Socket data

\- Not sophisticated enough for a full time trader, 

\- Incorporate the round trip profit ie account for fees on both ends

07/07/22,"So I started trading Bitcoin last week because I spent the last 2 months studying technical analysis and and have finally reached a level where I feel comfortable risking my money. I'm doing everything the classic trader does: observe multiple timeframes, calculate r/r, place SL and TP, etc. but I have absolutely zeroooo idea what to do when it comes to using indicators.

In the beginning I was using only RSI and SMAs to spot support/resistance levels and find good entries. They're simple enough, right? But now I stumbled upon other indicators like EMAs and boilinger bands. On CT I've even seen some use some weird ass ichimoku cloud indicators. 

My question is: which indicators should I use and how many?

I'm asking this because indicators have been a mixed bag for me. They both helped but also made me make quite a few bad trades. I don't want to waste time anymore using vaporwave indicators!!!",0.099,0.819,0.082,-0.5773
07/07/22,"Hey guys, hope you are having a wonderful time here on Reddit. Everybody knows what Bitcoin is. Moreover, almost everyone is familiar with its background, that’s why I am not going to share any info about the pizzas, blockchain, crypto exchanges and other stuff that everybody has probably already heard about or can google it in a few seconds.

I’ve been surfing the Internet for interesting crypto articles and found one that seems to be pretty provocative considering the religion and crypto mixed together in it. In this post I will briefly talk about the points.

Nowadays cryptocurrency and blockchain are the most popular matter of discussion in the world. If you are a regular to different crypto forums and media resources, you could eventually notice that Bitcoin has gathered a whole crowd of enthusiasts, or to be more precise, adepts, thinking it can be a real religion.

* **Lorcan Roche Kelly** from Bloomberg, a financial news provider, has said that BTC is “the first true religion of the 21st century.”. Also, **Hass McCook** called himself a Bitcoin Evangelist and “The Friar”. He has also written a few Medium posts comparing crypto to religion.
* The **Church of Bitcoin** was created in 2017. Its followers consider Satoshi Nakamoto to be their prophet.
* In Texas, there is an advertising campaign with huge billboards saying **“In crypto we trust”, “Crypto is real”** etc.

**What does BTC have in common with religion?**

I can’t really define what religion is because it’s something that has no official scientific meaning explained in the dictionary. All in all, religion is a summary of cultural ideas and doctrines which are related to life, death, and God interpretations. Usually, these depend on the origin countries.

Considering this, Bitcoin and cryptocurrency do not contain any of these topics which leads us to a logical conclusion — neither Bitcoin nor any other crypto are not connected to religion by no means.

**So why would people claim that BTC is a whole separate religion?**

Some, like Hass McCook, are using the religion terminology to emphasize some Bitcoin cultural aspects and make middlemen get used to them.

For instance, “stacking sats” (that’s when users purchase small pieces of Bitcoins) sounds strange. But McCook talks about the religious ritual while giving this process another name — “tithing”, used to call the little donations from members in order to support their church.

So, in this situation, the word actually makes the action sound good and principled.

Additionally, some Bitcoiners think that BTC is not only the way to make money but also the ultimate answer to all people’s problems. “Because the root cause of all of our problems is basically money printing and capital misallocation as a result of that,” McCook argues, “the only way the whales are going to be saved, or the trees are going to be saved, or the kids are going to be saved, is if we just stop the degeneracy.” Such an attitude might be the reason for comparing BTC with religion.

**In view of the foregoing, do you think cryptocurrency is related to a religious theme, and could Bitcoin become a new religion that solves all of humanity’s problems? If yes, why? Or why not?**",0.045,0.865,0.09,0.968

The BTCGBP (I follow) pair hasn't been great recently, and the BTCUSD is also a bit vague. Looking at the BTCJPY pair it's clear price action has being really influenced by JPY.

Given that BTC is such an obvious arbitrage point for forex finding these relationships seems pretty important. If anyone has any recommendations on new sources, strategies etc, I'd be really interested to hear. I'm not familiar with multipair arb techniques.

Dear fellow bitcoiners.
I like trading. Sure, im no pro, but its just fun to do.

I only have 100% btc in my portfolio, no alts in this state of the market.

I currently trade in the 30 minute timeframe chart. In 3 weeks time, i made about 600 usdt profit. However,  btc rose from  19k to 23k .. so basiclyi would have gained more from just hodling. Therefor, i think trading on a higher timeframe would probably be better.

My question: what indicators do you use (im on tradingview)? I usually have just some sma/ema and the macd and stoch rsi.

Or should i just resort to hodl btc and sell bits by bits during a rally and buy back after the dip?

09/12/22,"Ive seen a lot of posts about market manipulation and how trading is a scam. So here's a little something to help out the newbie traders that are struggling to understand it all.

Markets work in structure and ranges. Trading is recognising and identifying the current structure of a market within the current range.

The more you trade, the quicker you'll get at identifying the current structure. 

When I first started trading, price to me just looked completely random. It isn't, just keep looking and training your brain.

How many lines should you have on a chart? Just 2, one for the range top and one for the range bottom. Having these 2 lines will help your brain hone in on the current range. Scalp within the range. 

When you feel it's time for price to leave the range, start using a trailing stop; to catch the trend to the next range or stop out at break even. Once you reach the next range, punch out the moment price starts reversing. Statistically, you'll make more money, even if you miss a big move.

Description copy and pasted:

Facebook tried to disrupt the world - and the world says ""no."" Facebook launched Libra in June 2019. Libra would be an international currency and payment system. It would flow instantly around the world by phone. It could even ""bank the unbanked."" But Libra would also make Facebook too big to control- and lead the way for Facebook's Silicon Valley fellows to swing the power of their money as they pleased. Facebook and their friends could work around any single country's rules. Libra could shake whole economies and Facebook would become the ""digital identity"" provider to the world. Governments looked at Libra - and saw another 2008 financial crisis in the making. Facebook's plan would have made the company even more entrenched - at the cost of broken economies worldwide; starting with toppling the US dollar.

""Libra Shrugged"" is the story of a bad idea.

Bio: David Gerard writes the cryptocurrency and blockchain news site Attack of the 50 Foot Blockchain. He is the author of the 2017 book Attack of the 50 Foot Blockchain: Bitcoin, Blockchain, Ethereum &amp; Smart Contracts and the 2020 book Libra Shrugged: How Facebook Tried to Take Over the Money. Until he reinstalled the laptop they were on, he was the proud owner of six Dogecoins. He remains a frequent, if occasionally annoyed, user of Facebook.

As well as being a crypto journalist, David also works as a Unix system administrator, where his job includes keeping track of exciting new technologies, and advising against the bad ones. He has also been an award-winning music journalist, and has blogged about music at Rocknerd.co.uk since 2001. He is a volunteer spokesman for Wikipedia, and for skeptical wiki RationalWiki.org.

09/26/22,"Please don’t downvote me for this question, I’m just trying to ask people’s serious opinions. I’ve been in Bitcoin since 2017 and have not always been able to hold strong because it always feels like “this time is different” and that this time “it really is over.” As you can tell I deal with pretty bad generalized anxiety. My fear and stress can be overwhelming sometimes but I also try desperately to make decisions not based on blind belief in a project. 

I know in 2018 after the crash it really felt like Bitcoin was over, but obviously it wasn’t, but for some reason this time it feels like after the crash of Terra and of UST, the collapse of so so many online “crypto banking” sites like Celsius and voyager and more, and the current massive generalized negative public view of Bitcoin and crypto as useless and just as scams run by shitty influencers and celebrities that maybe this time it really is over and it isn’t going to hit it’s all time high again. I don’t know if that’s my anxiety speaking or just maybe what I believe currently based on those facts I just stated about how much the crypto market has shifted and how many bad things have happened in the last year since the all time high. 

I held my bitcoin strong obviously during the recent all time high almost a year ago, and have since lost just over 6 figures in value by deciding to not sell back then. I really just want to know people’s opinions on what they themselves believe. 

I know no one can predict the future, but I’m not asking for predictions more just everyone’s individual beliefs about whether bitcoin will ever recover it’s all time high and if they do believe it will, how long they believe it might take.",0.155,0.762,0.084,-0.9803

10/06/22,"So I’ve been trading futures in this App, BM.ex, that an online friend recommended as its her choice for trading.
The thing is that for opening and closing kinda fast it works nicely, but it has some weird spikes sometimes that I don’t see in other apps or analysis, and weird steps in the price that suddenly change the price around 100btc . A different friend kinda explained why it happens and it made sense but I don’t really fully understand it, but i was lucky enough that I got one of those in my favor and i made 2kUSDT. Lucky me! But now I want to cash out and sent it to my binance wallet, and I get more red flags than the communist party.

For two days the transfer it’s been on hold, “Withdrawal Applying”, and it doesn’t get to my other wallet. I wrote to the costumer service several times and they barely answer any questions, just tell me to stop trading and wait. But all my trading funds are in the app and I am catching nice trends (sometimes because of the spikes I talked bout) and I don’t wanna miss a good chance just waiting, and they don’t tell me why. Previously they asked for a photo of me with my ID but they fixed nothing, and now they said as follows (BIGGEST RED FLAG SO FAR! 🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩

“Hello! You need to suspend trading and pay 30% of the total funds in your account as your risk margin to unlock your account.”

I am quite shocked and definitely lost on what to do, as I paid the fee for each transaction and this is as close to blackmail as I have ever seen. I’m even willing to pay to get my money but they are so slow to answer the chat logged out before the CS guy even answered how I should “pay” (there’s no option even close in the interface to solve this).

So I’m lost on what to do and I am getting sooooo many red flags vibes…

What do you guys think I should do? 

Also… Do you recommend any other app to change to after this? (Preferably to trade futures from the EU with low quantity, I’ve been looking for one since binance stopped supporting futures here) 


thank you guys in advance

EDIT: IT WAS A SCAM!!!

Yeah, you guessed it. My “friend” knows inside information from the app, and she purposely gave me bad trends (and I’m sure she manually changed a value in-App because the value went from 19.883 to 20.883 in a vertical jump as soon as I gave “confirmation” to invest short) and also she’s very mad I promised I’d have money ready but I made it trading on my own instead of transferring. 

But I’m not even mad! She taught me great investment skills and I made money!

But yeah, it’s dangerous to leave it out there. So, if you want to help the community and protect from scammers here’s the link to the app. You can give it bad reviews and download to report a scam.

***Remember Me?***

Guess who's back, the creator of DCAStack. I posted in this subreddit a year ago about a new project I was launching to help automate your DCA into bitcoin. It was met with a lot of skepticism and criticism which was valuable feedback.

So today I'm here to showcase the next generation of my project that enables ***Trustless, Transparent, Trading***. No more sharing API keys, no more revealing your personal information to strangers and no more trusting centralized exchanges. 

&amp;nbsp;

***Why?***

I built this web app because I was so fed up with the lack of options in Dollar Cost Averaging. The current situation with DCA is:

* Centralized exchange fees to DCA are too high
* Trading bot websites need your API keys
* Give up complete custody of your funds with no transparency

And so, DCAStack was reborn.  Built for the community, open sourced and hoping to restore your purchasing power :)


&amp;nbsp;

***How does it work?***


With the beauty of smart contracts, you no longer have to share your API keys with anyone to take advantage of dollar cost averaging tools. The best way to see DCA Stack is simply as an account you manage and fund to automate your dollar cost averaging schedules. 

To get started, you will need to deposit two things, gas and the token you want to sell to DCA into your desired token. So if you wanted to DCA into WBTC every day with 1 DAI (or any token/stablecoin) for 30 days, you would:

1.  Deposit 30 DAI (1 DAI x 30 trades)
2.  Deposit gas to cover 30 trades
3.  Let DCAStack do the rest! 


Here's what the dashboard looks like with an active schedule: 

Your funds are always liquid, so there are no lockups of any kind and you are free to withdraw any and all funds at your discretion. 

And here's the ability to manage your funds: 

&amp;nbsp;

***Note on Bugs :O***

There will be bugs and due to this simple fact, we have decided to launch on the goerli testnet to address them. With the community's help, we'd love to gather feedback and help resolve all of them so that we can launch a bug free version on a L2. 

Anyone who submits feedback that helps resolve a bug or a critical issue, will get free trading for when we decide to add a fee schedule (TBD). We'd love to hear your thoughts, ideas, improvements and anything else you have for DCAStack so please chime in on discord :)",0.057,0.763,0.181,0.9959

10/26/22,"In order to maximize money markets, traders need to understand the underlying trend in the market and capitalize on it accordingly. But how does it make a difference doing futures trade?

Here are some of my take aways on the time frame thing.

1. It refers to how long a trend lasts
2. Time frames are actionable right now for scalpers and doesn't interest day traders.
3. There are time frames that should be on your radar, especially those that can confirm a pattern, or otherwise.
4. Time frames ranges from seconds to minutes, hours, days and even weeks.

Once the underlying trend on an asset is identified, traders can now then execute their positions.

Here are examples how time frames are beneficial for users.

**Swing trader**\- Focuses on daily chart decisions or make use of weekly TF for the trend analysis.

**Day trader**\- could make use 15-minute chart up to 60-minute chart for short time trend analysis.

**Scalper-** could make use of lower TF, either that may be 15m, 5m, 1m, or 1s time frame due to highfrequency trading.

In honor of the [2013] [2014] [2015] [2016] [2017] [2018] [2019] [2020] and [2021] prediction threads, I present to you the 2022 prediction thread. **What do you think bitcoin's price will be come Dec 25th 2023 at 22:00 UTC?**

I gotta be honest... this year I dropped the ball with both contest winners of the 2020 thread and 2021 thread from last year. I'll be contacting them and ironing it out by no later than Jan 15th.

In case anybody here is new to the tradition, contest goes like so: 

- I pledge to give 0.00146 BTC (roughly equivalent to $24 is at the moment) to the closest prediction. If you predicted price higher than $16.5K and win, you will recieve 0.000146 BTC (guaranteed to be $24 or more), if you predicted a price lower than $16.5K and win, you will recieve $24 worth of bitcoin (guaranteed to be 0.00146 or more). Bitstamp.com will be used to determine the winner of the contest. You can have however many predictions in your comment, and feel free to ponder as much as you'd like, but the last predicted BTC price on the comment will be the one that applies to the contest. **Edited comments are disqualified.** In case of multiple comments, whichever comment was made first will be the applicant to the contest. Cut off date to enter is January 20th 2023. You are encouraged to include the reasoning behind your prediction. Your prediction should preferably be a top-level post and in USD, for ease of tabulation.

my post just got removed from r/Bitcoin because market discussions belong here, I was told. Well, then I write it all again haha

I know no one wants to hear bearish sentiment these days, but I think the  joy of the bull market is far too early. I've compared the sentiment to  the 2018/19 pattern, which is currently commonly used as a comparison  to the current situation, and I can't find this bullish sentiment. To be honest, I believe the uptrend is heavily manipulated at the moment. But  see for yourself:

This  is the famous 2018/19 pattern. You can see a nice bottoming out for  months, fear slowly turning to greed at the same price level. In the  end, Bitcoin shoots up and experiences Extreme Greed for 9 days in a row  until the mania levels off a bit for a few days, but Greed keeps  getting the upper hand and finally ushers in the bull market:

[

Chart Source: [



And that's the current pattern. As  you can see, the bottoming out is also nice to see, Fear becomes Greed  at the same price level, but in a much too short time. Then, as Bitcoin  rose, Extreme Greed only lasted 3 days and then flattened out. Ok yes, there was another upswing after that (where we are now), but sentiment  is flattening out anyway. I therefore believe that this upswing has  been manipulated and that it is not retailers who are buying massively  here. I believe that retail should be linked to buy here and then it  will be dumped. It wouldn't surprise me if we were able to hold the  price level for a few more days, but the sentiment became less and less  positive. Of course, that remains to be seen, but I think that the ""bull  run"" has nothing in common with 2018/19:

[

Chart Source: [



Maybe I'm completely wrong with my  analysis, then I'll admit it. Still I hope you remain cautious, because  something is in the air I think..

Info: Before anyone claims that my analysis is BS because someone think it's based on the well-known BTC Fear &amp; Greed Index (the one shared on Twitter), which says FEAR when it goes down and GREED when it goes up (lol), I'll  preface it and say no :)  I used the one from hodlhub, sources added, which has nothing to do with the well-known meme indicator.

I was thinking we as the crypto community could come to the rescue and buy them out and at the same time we'd receive an independent nation that is able to set its own rules and doesn't answer to anyone. That way we could become the first nation that fully embraces crypto and crypto would be the very foundation of our nation. This would result in us being able to relieve ourselves of all the limits put upon us by countries that we live in since many of our governments are anti crypto. You might ask why would we buy a sinking island? Well the fact is from now until 100 years when it might be under water, that's more than enough time for us to make huge profits by creating the first crypto country. In that time we could also come up with a way to stop the island from sinking. The profit potential of creating a crypto country is massive and everyone involved has the opportunity to cash in on the biggest moonshot they've ever witnessed.

Tuvalu has a population of approximately 10k people and my plan is to offer each person $1million so $10 billion in total. And for that we would take ownership of the country and we would help all of them move off the island. The people that helped raise the funds to buy the nation could move to and become citizens of the new country. And the companies that provided funding could set up operations in the new country and receive a lot of benefits. Tuvalu has a gdp of $63 million so $10 billion is more than 160x bigger than the size of their gdp. The country could have a vote on whether they will accept this offer and I have a strong feeling they will be in favor of it. Once we buy the nation and turn it into a crypto country we can have crypto casinos, country backed crypto currency, entire crypto economy etc. the money we generate from this will be insane. Also the $1m per person and $10 billion is just an estimate, the actual amount we would pay could be lower than that.

And I repeat Tuvalu is an independent nation so there's no limit to what we can do with it once we're in control. There are smaller ""nations"" with smaller populations like the Falkland Islands but these are dependencies that are still somewhat controlled by countries like the UK so they aren't a good option. Tuvalu is the independent nation with the smallest population so that's why I chose it. Another option is Nauru which has a population of 12k and Palau which has a population of 17k. These are all independent nations and they all have some risk of being submerged underwater so they could be willing to work with us and make a deal. Also one good thing about Palau is it's much bigger than the other islands. Palau is 460 km2 which is about 2.6 times bigger than washington D.C.

I will put together a proposal and send it to the people of these nations and their respective governments. They will heavily consider it and with the support of the crypto community I'm sure they'll accept the offer. We will need the crypto community to come together and provide the funding to purchase one of the nations but just remember that the profit potential here is huge. If you help buy one of the nations you could be set for life.

We will need to show the nations we will actually be able to come up with the funds to buy them. So as proof that there is interest to buy out these nations I was thinking we could do a wallet signing campaign. No one has to send any funds but users &amp; companies of different blockchains in the crypto space could provide a signature from their wallets showing they're interested in buying these nations. If enough people &amp; companies in the crypto space provide enough signatures we could have wallets with crypto in the billions signaling they're interested in buying these nations. I want to work with the leads of every crypto blockchain and project to get this campaign started. If there's a project you're invested in tell them we need to buy a nation and tell them to join the campaign. Together we can get this done.

We will also create a community of people that are interested in creating this new crypto country. So let me know if you want to help make this happen.",0.029,0.867,0.104,0.995

I am looking for some nuanced takes on my thought process here. I´ve been in crypto for a few years now. In the bullrun of 2021 I started dabbling a little bit in altcoins, winning some and losing some. But the more I dabbled in altcoins, the less focused and more time-consuming my investment strategy become.

Most of my gains came from buying a couple of Bitcoin in 2019 and forgetting about it, but after dabbling in altcoins I started staring paralysed at charts all day. What are all these acronyms? Result; about the same gains as I would have had just holding BTC and touching grass. Others in my trading group have much better success.

I dont have a problem with altcoins necessarily, except I dont understand them and they fill me with this sense of greed and inadequateness. Most of them are vaporware sure, but as a short term trade I see potential in increasing my Bitcoin stack.

Its just ... they seem to drag me into this downwards carousel of greed and obsession. Taking time away from business and family, tempting me into emotional decisions. I feel I understand Bitcoin - digital gold, money, hedge against shit-hits-the-fan. Maybe thats why Bitcoin dont trigger the same greedy obsession in me.

TLDR; anybody went Bitcoin only not mainly because of ideological reasons, but because of easier investment strategies? What was your reasoning, and did you stick to it? What has your results been?

Calm yourself in the wake of the fake(out) and think big picture.

### Bull Case

Here's your bull case going into the weekend:

* 12h Bbands are tightening
* Obvious bull flag on the weekly 
* Every bitcoin available under 30k has been bought… maybe more than once
* BTC mooning for MSTR is going to melt minds
* SBF and the Shitcoiners (acapella, first gig in the prison courtyard next month) are out of service and can’t limit this run (with fucking gifs, you twats, are you kidding me???) like they did last time 

### No, I really mean BULL CASE

Why don’t you have a full stack of coins yet???


We’ve experienced enough price discovery between 29k and 50k that in the next month or two, we could rocket up to test prices ~50k. Testing 30k and 40k isn’t required because we have already spent _months_ in that range with high volume trading. When significant trading happens in a price range, buyers tend to hold onto their assets for longer. **Bitcoiners who bought 30-40k are now officially hodlers** and their bitcoins are not a source of liquidity. When we hit 30k, we’re basically limited to the lendable supply and the mined supply. That supply isn’t enough to hold back bull market FOMO.

tl:dr; No bitcoins for you between 30k and 40k

### Recent Projection Performance

I posted a price projection in February on TradingView that's unfolding fairly well.



#### So easy to predict

It isn't hard for this projection to perform, because targets are both conservative and broad:

* **Worst case** start the halving at around 26k
* **Best case** start the halving at around 80k

Between now and the halving prices could:

* go as high as 69k
* go as low as 26k

In February, I also posted that I didn't think, at _any_ point, we'd exceed the teal line. But I will amend that prediction to say: we might peak somewhere _near_ the teal line toward the end of 2024. This would mean the next bull run caps at:

* **worst case** 130k
* **best case** 280k

Today, I am interested to hear from anyone who has been successful in unlocking their account by talking to Coinbase support. You don't have to look far to find disgruntled customers who are locked into a long wait with seemingly unresponsive support.

I know what you're thinking, I must have done something wrong that I am not telling you all about but I don't know how I can convince you all. I'll say I am squeaky clean, no tax evasion, no nefarious dealings, no suspicious sources of income.

My case has been escalated, I've seen a number of posts that have received almost identical responses and so I don't know how much solace can be sought from that.

I haven't been accused of anything at this stage, maybe it is just a security review, but I had no notification that my account would be blocked and no request for information prior to trying to log in only to discover my account blocked.

The majority of cryptocurrencies are also trading in losses on September's opening day, with some losing up to 7%. According to Coinglass data, the total value of crypto liquidations in the last 24 hours is $129 million. According to Bitcoin's monthly returns chart, BTC has had six ""negative Septembers"" in a row since 2016. Within these six years, 2019 witnessed the greatest loss of 13.47%, while 2022 losses were relatively lower at 3.12%. However, historical precedent may not predict current outcomes because the crypto market never fails to surprise. 

Being the start of September, it may be difficult to gauge Bitcoin's price action based on a one-day performance.
Bitcoin may choose to break the bearish trend this September and close in the green for the first time in six years.

Having followed the prevalence of the topic ""Bitcoin"" in the financial news since January 2022, I see that since late March 2023 prevalence has dropped significantly. Though, from start July 2023 prevalence has picked up again, had a few curves, but has now broken up again. On the other hand, sentiment has been more and more positive since mid March 2023. In mid March 2023, we saw a big increase in the price of Bitcoin. I looked into it, and found that the more the news were addressing the ""Banking crisis"" topic, the more Bitcoin increased in value. Info a bit off the topic, but still. No news in the fact that Bitcoin is impacted by a lot of factors, some factors impact more than others. So, I will try to keep following the prevalence of Bitcoin, and post if I come across anything that sems to have a relation to the price of Bitcoin. I am one of those who believes that Bitcoin, and crypto's in general are here to stay. With the next halving approaching It will be even more interesting to follow Bitcoin.
  

  
If you have any idea of what might be impacting the price of Bitcoin, please write me or chat me, then I will look into it asap.

Is Binance.us still ok for btc trading?

I ask because Binance.us currently has fee free btc trading.  I’m surprised by the low daily volume though. Can a small account of around 10k effectively day trade on it? It looks attractive for active bot trading also since fees are zero.

I need to get my btc off kucoin as I’m in the US and with it having kyc requirements now a vpn is no longer enough to obfuscate me to keep trading with them. Unless there’s a way?

10/15/23,"
Right now 900 new BTC are mined per day. At current price, the amount of new money flowing in to keep price at equilibrium is roughly $24 million per day to offset the newly created supply.

Asset managers for spot ETF applications submitted currently have around $17 trillion in assets under management. Suppose just 1% of that allocation flows into BTC upon approval, that would be $170 billion. Now suppose that $170 billion comes in gradually over the course of 4 years to reach just that 1% allocation. That would equate to an average of $116 million in new money pouring in every single day. That’s nearly 5x as much as the amount needed to keep current price at equilibrium at current block reward. Once the halving occurs next year, it’s nearly 10x as much as the amount needed to keep current price at equilibrium. This is just assuming a 1% allocation from these fund managers reached over the course of 4 years.

With odds of a spot ETF approval being higher than ever in light of recent developments, there’s a very real possibility that we will get a spot ETF approved at least 3 months before BTC’s halving in April where new supply issuance schedule will drop to 450 newly mined BTC per day. So, with potential for an enormous wave of previously sidelined demand hitting the market you should really take this into consideration if you haven’t already: what happens if BTC reaches a new ATH BEFORE the halving for the first time ever?

Predictable 4 year cycles effectively go out the window if/when that happens at least for a halving or two. Spot ETF approval potentially marks the beginning of the vertical part of S curve adoption as fund managers spend the next several years trying to get to their target portfolio allocation, whatever that percentage amount ends up being. Additionally, [futures are pricing in rate cuts from the Fed to begin by middle of next year.]

We basically have a perfect storm trifecta of demand shock, supply shock, and favorable monetary policy scheduled to arrive within a short window of time of one another. I sincerely hope everyone here is using this time wisely as it becomes increasingly likely that we won’t be able to buy at these price levels for much longer and once we finally leave this range of $24.7-$31.8k that we’ve been stuck in for 7 months now, we’re never seeing these prices ever again.",0.043,0.855,0.102,0.9766

Now we could see a similar pattern that plays out (orange lines) This triangle is not as nice as the previous one, but it has 3 points of contact for both lines. We broke now also to the upside. If we retest the upper line again, we would need to go back into the 25k-27k region depending on timing. From there the next bullrun could emerge with a target of 132k (magnitude of the triangle at the crossing point).

If we take a look at the 11 months prior to the previous BTC halving event which would be the last 6 months of 2019 and the first 5 months of 2020, BTC remained below the major $10,300 resistance level for 8 months before retracing in March 2020 during the COVID pandemic.

10/24/23,"We're about a month away from the 10 year mark from when bitcoin crossed $1000 for the first time. 

Back then I was a 24 year old professional trader in NYC and I was the only person on my prop desk who was actively trading bitcoin. Here are some of the lessons/observations I learned:

1) Bitcoin/crypto (to me it was just bitcoin) was the wild west of trading and that comes with a ton of risk and opportunity. The risk is you have your money in the wrong spot, it can disappear without any wrongdoing on your part--counterparty risk. I had my money on MtGox briefly but thankfully I moved it to Bitfinex b/c BFX had leverage. Back then BFX was a nascent exchange ran by one French guy in his basement and it had a lot of glitches--for example btc would trade at $80 and I could get executed at $20 with some crafty order placement. Didn't happen often but I made a few thousand risk-free just with these print through executions.  Nowadays bitcoin isn't nearly as thin or volatile and exchanges aren't glitchy -- I  don't/can't trade it the same way because I don't have the same edges.

2) I thought most ""btc investors"" were just dreamers/cultists back then. This gave me the mental flexibility to trade bitcoin without getting too attached. Little did I know, the ""dream"" would become very, very real with bitcoin going over $10,000 in 2017 and over 50,000 in 2020. While my returns as a trader are pretty solid, they don't come close to the returns of someone who simply held bitcoin at the time I first started trading it with serious risk at $250. That's ok though, I have no regrets. And I've actually become a believer myself, holding a few coins as a buy/hold investor.

3) I come from a very active trading background. I day trade stocks on a short timeframe, back then even a micro timeframe where I'd hold for 10-20 minutes max on my scalps. I tried to apply this strategy to bitcoin by scalping very harsh dips and selling into the rallies and it worked but it was extremely stressful. The scalping setup equivalent of bitcoin might take an entire day to play out and that's an entire day of monitoring the market depth and price. I'd often take my laptop everywhere and set alarms at night, which at the time there was only one--a site called bitcoinity where it played the Darth Vader NOOOOOOOOOOOO soundbite from Revenge of the Sith. That shit was a nightmare.

Anyway, I've been writing about my adventures in trading and just wrote about my 2013 experience trading bitcoin in this post: [ \--  I met an executive at BitInstant (almost got to invest with Charlie Shrem before he got arrested!) via another friend on my desk and we both traded 400 bitcoins in October 2013. We ended up outperforming buy/hold on bitcoin (for that given timeframe) by 4x magnitude through a combination of active trading (scalping 20-25% dips using leverage) and lending out USD on bitfinex. Needless to say I lost a lot of sleep.

I've tried to catch up and have gone through various news sources and forums, but there seems to be no clear consensus on what's driving this bullish behavior.Could anyone here provide a concise explanation or update on what factors have contributed to this recent boom in Bitcoin's price? Have there been any significant changes in regulations, technological advancements, institutional adoption, or any geopolitical contexts that are influencing this rally? Also, were there any early indicators that I missed, which were pointing to this scenario?I'd really appreciate any insights or resources you can share to help me understand the current market dynamics better. It feels like I've missed a significant chapter in the Bitcoin story, and I'm eager to get back on track.Thanks a lot!",0.047,0.766,0.187,0.9758

 [

Part 1:  BTC 4-Year Price Ratios

I have BTC price data going back to Aug 2011, so I have 4-Y price ratios from Aug 2015.  Chart 1 shows BTC price, the 4-year price ratio, and the 1-year median of the 4-Y ratio.  For a little over 4 years (mid 2017 to late 2021) the 4-year ratio varied between 10x and 50x.  When the blow-off top never materialized after the 2020 halving, the 4-year ratio fell into a new, lower range.  Chart 2 shows the same data, but with the ratio plotted on a linear scale instead of log.

Chart 3 is a close-up of this new range (2.5x - 7x).  This new range is just under 2 years old.  The previous range held for 4 years, what if this range holds for another 2?  That leads us to Chart 4.

Chart 4 BTC plots 2.5x (green) and 7x (red) the price 4 years earlier against the current price. Looking out 2 years, it suggests  a BTC price between $80K and $200K.

Part 2: 50-D /200-D SMA Crosses

Chart 5 shows BTC price (black), the 50-D SMA (orange), and the 200-D SMA (red).  In addition, I've plotted the non-dimensional 50/200 gap (\[50D - 200D\]/200D) in blue.  Ratio peaks corresponding to cycle tops are marked with black stars (I'm treating the first of the two peaks in 2021 as the top for this analysis).

After the late 2013 peak, the gap crashed negative.  It briefly broke positive twice (1 & 2) , then broke positive and stayed positive all the way through to the 2017 peak (3).  

After the late 2017 peak, the gap crashed negative.  It first broke positive for a longer time than the previous cycle  (1) , then again for a very short time (2) similar to the previous cycle.  It then broke positive and stayed positive all the way through to the 2021 peak (3).  

After the late 2021 peak, the gap crashed negative.  It broke positive for a period between the prior cycles  (1) , then again for a longer period (2).  A few days ago, it broke positive for the third time since the last cycle top (3).

Also of interest is the bottoming of the gap below -0.3, marked with orange.  This has happened three times.  The first two times were excellent entry points.

I need advice/help with contacting key partners. We are a service that enables businesses (or individuals) to conduct transactions in cryptocurrencies via the Lightning network. We exclusively work with Bitcoin (sats).  
Most of our clients use our service at the local level (Slovakia, the Czech Republic), but we also have partners from abroad: Germany, Spain, Austria, and China.  
**What?**  
A service to accept payment for products/services in bitcoins/sats.  
**Goal:** Provide the service to foreign businesses' operators. Ideally with high-turnover goods, such as restaurants (catering services), bars, grocery stores, and gas stations. Secondarily: shopping centers, individuals, or events (where tickets could be purchased). I would also prefer bookstores. My goal is to expand this service further internationally, primarily in the USA, but I am open to any country.

  
**Benefits for partnered organization:**  
Deployment is entirely free.  
Fees are paid by the end user but can be configured with a markup or discount for BTC LN payments as needed.  
Security   
Simplicity – we will train you on how to use the system correctly (or your employees).  
Payments are verified through a so-called three-factor authentication via Signal (we try to anonymize the process if the client wishes).  
When choosing to withdraw cryptocurrencies to your wallet, you can request the operator to pay the accumulated amount for a specific period.  
This is the service: [  
**What do I need?**  
Could you recommend me someone (an establishment, restaurant, grocery store) that you think would be open to using this service (at least try it)?   
Alternatively, you can contact me via my personal email: [nikola.nika.kotlarikova@gmail.com](mailto:nikola.nika.kotlarikova@gmail.com) (prefer it more as I check it more frequently) or my work email: [info@nikakotlarikova.sk](mailto:info@nikakotlarikova.sk)",0.006,0.916,0.078,0.9692

My understanding is incomplete. Be kind. I’m learning.

I’m trying to understand how smaller inflows of capital could result in a disproportionate increase in bitcoin price without the need for large movements in market cap e.g. the so-called ‘multiplier effect’ that Bank of America reported.

I see one-sided arguments on why a $250k+ bitcoin price “is” and “is not” possible this bull cycle. However, these arguments do not often incorporate both the ‘Market Cap’ and ‘Multiplier Effect‘ perspectives.

Are there any examples of the multiplier effect in other asset classes where the price moved substantially without large capital inflows?

Also, this doesn’t take into account other functions that Bitcoin may fulfill in time. Standard of money. Increasing use as a currency. Endless possibilities. These could and likely would increase bitcoin’s value further. 
In the year after the first halving in July 2012, price went from around $2.32 in December 2011 to $190 in April 2013. 82x. 10.5M btc were mined 50%
After the second halving price went from $396 in December 2015 to $19720 in December of 2017, 49x. 15.75M btc had been mined. 75% 
3rd, $7200 December 2019-$68,000 in November 2021. 9x 18.375M bitcoin mined. 87.5%
As we approach the next halving in April 2024, we are around $44,000. 93.75% of Bitcoin will have been mined. 
As you can see, after each halving the price goes up, but less so after each subsequent event. 
Plotting each ATH against the % mined is only meaningful on a logarithmic scale. If X axis is % mined and Y axis is price in log, one sees a rather straight line up and to the right. 
This is where I am out of my water. I’m searching on excel to find a formula that would express the relation of the ATH log-10 versus the % of Bitcoin mined. Eyeballing a rough log-10 graph, it appears to be in the range of $200,000. 
The other item O noticed when plotting these numbers is that the movement along the X or % mined axis are getting closer and closer together. So even though the ATH increases logarithmically, the increasingly smaller movement along the C axis limits the corresponding result on the Y axis. 
As we know, this halving will progress until the last whole bitcoin is mined.

12/16/23,"Elizabeth Warren seeks to ban Bitcoin to stop terrorism financing, but it’s Israel’s Netanyahu that funded Hamas.  
**We highly recommend you read this even if you already agree or don't particularly care about foreign policy, because it arms you with the facts to be able to convince others on this critical issue.**  
Warren’s defacto ban:  
Elizabeth Warren has again pushed for sweeping regulatory changes with the supposed purpose of cracking down on cryptocurrency’s use in terrorist financing. She said “We need new laws to crack down on crypto’s use in enabling terrorist groups” \[1\] She wishes to force all Bitcoin and cryptocurrency open source wallet providers and miner/node infrastructure to do AML/KYC checks, which is impossible for a decentralized permissionless system. Therefore, Warren effectively wants to ban it.  
Our central premise is that Warren’s regulatory proposals would do massive harm to civil liberties and would NOT achieve the stated purpose. Furthermore, we argue that the general public is not properly educated on the true actions of the Israeli government regarding Hamas, and that all future decisions regarding terrorism should be considered with this information.  
Warren’s Wrong on Hamas:  
Regarding crypto’s use in terrorism, the claims Warren’s making are a gross misrepresentation of the facts. First her proposed bills cite a Wall Street Journal article which uses data from the blockchain analytics firm Elliptic \[2\]. But the company that’s cited in the WSJ article, Elliptic, says this is untrue \[3\]. Elliptic said on their own blog post: “There is no evidence to suggest that crypto fundraising has raised anything close to this amount, and data provided by Elliptic and others has been misinterpreted. We have spoken to representatives of the lead signatory, Senator Warren, as well as the authors of the Wall Street Journal article, to clarify this.” \[3\]  
Warren includes funds that the cryptocurrency exchange in question owned, ignoring if those funds were owned by Hamas or not. This is equivalent to counting the bank and an individual with an account as the same entity. Even the blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis, which is normally tough on the need for regulation, has disputed Warren’s claims as a gross misrepresentation. \[4\] In their own blog post they stated that “We have seen recent estimates related to the attacks on Israel that appear to include all flows to certain service providers that received some funds associated with terrorism financing. In other words, those totals include funds not explicitly related to terrorism financing.” \[4\].  
Israel funded Hamas:  
Despite the false accusations and propaganda spewing from Elizabeth Warren’s holes, it’s actually Israel’s own government that propped up Hamas for years using fiat money. While many readers will be quick to dismiss Libertarian news outlets such as AntiWar.com which have posted this type of information for years. They will have a hard time dismissing the New York Times which recently covered this exact issue. \[5\] Netanyahu propped up and empowered Hamas with billions of dollars over the course of years, for the purpose of preventing a peace deal which would force Israel to give up land on the West Bank.  
Quotes from the New York Times in italics:  
“Shlomo Brom, a retired general and former deputy to Israel’s national security adviser, said an empowered Hamas helped Mr. Netanyahu avoid negotiating over a Palestinian state.” \[5\]  
As long as Hamas was in-charge of the Gaza Strip, Israel could say at the UN “look we have no partner for peace”. Then they’d avoid having to make land successions:  
“Mr. Lieberman: “For Netanyahu, there is only one thing that is really important: to be in power at any cost,” he said. “To stay in power, he preferred to pay for tranquility.” Suitcases filled with cash soon began crossing the border into Gaza” \[5\]  
And this same money was what enabled the terrorism attacks on Oct 7th and NOT Bitcoin as Elizabeth Warren will have you believe.  
“Israeli intelligence officials now believe that the money had a role in the success of the Oct. 7 attacks, if only because the donations allowed Hamas to divert some of its own budget toward military operations.” \[5\]  
Our main point  
We question the use of US tax dollars to prop up Israel to empower Hamas as a legitimate use of either country’s taxpayer funds. Furthermore, we argue that without proper disciplinary measures taken against this type of action, further corruption could potentially occur. And most importantly, our core thesis is that banning Bitcoin for this negligent action from Netanyahu, represents an unnecessary trampling of individual civil liberties and a gross misrepresentation of the facts. This comes from a philosophical, historical, legal, and logistical angles.  
From a philosophical angle, we argue that anything could potentially be used for terror, and it is not the role of the government decide what technology or speech is legitimate. In fact, the primary purpose of Bitcoin was to protect against inflation. It was created in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, right as Barrack Obama entered office and corruption occurred.  
Wikileaks leaked emails show that Barrack Obama got orders from Citibank’s CEO on who his cabinet should include \[7\], right before that same cabinet (Timothy Geithner) went on to bailout Citibank with massive inflation that Bitcoin was designed to resist. So Elizabeth Warren is saying that one of the only tools designed and used to protect citizens against government overreach and corruption, should be controlled by government overreach for your own protection?  
From a legal perspective, Bitcoin is really just encrypted text and therefore, this speech’s value is subjective and the constitutional freedom of speech applies. The government does not have the authority to dictate writings on distributed ledgers. There’s no entity to sanction. You can’t sanction speech.  
From a practical perspective, cryptocurrency can not be controlled globally given it’s massive global popularity and technical design to resist governments across borders. Therefore, governments would only deprive law abiding citizens of their civil liberties with low benefit to actually stopping crime. Even ex-CIA officials will tell you this.  
Yaya J. Fanusie is a former CIA analyst and director of policy for anti-money laundering and cyber risk at the Crypto Council for Innovation. Yaya said quote “The U.S. doesn’t need new legislation or enforcement tools to go after Hamas’s crypto holdings.” and “U.S. government should take concrete steps to ensure that crypto exchange businesses continue to flourish onshore, where the U.S. has better regulatory reach.” \[6\]

12/18/23,"Cast your mind back to mid-October. The price of Bitcoin was $27K, bulls were waiting for confirmation of a spot ETF, and bears were waiting for one last capitulation. Since then the price has increased +55% to $42K at the time of writing; the price briefly hit $44k in early December. The price rally was driven by rumours that the SEC will confirm the spot ETF - they actually delayed the decision to Q1 24 - and speculation that the FED will reduce interest rates. Regardless of whether you are a bull or a bear, everyone trading or investing in Bitcoin wants to know: what is Bitcoin really worth?

One way to estimate the true value of Bitcoin is to benchmark it against something else. Bitcoin is commonly compared to Gold. This post will estimate the true value of Bitcoin by using Gold as a benchmark. Fidelity Digital Assets, a subsidiary of Fidelity Investments, has completed the first step of benchmarking Bitcoin vs Gold by comparing the fundamentals. See [this link] and comparison chart below. The conclusion is that as a store of value, Bitcoin is better or equal to gold in six out of seven characteristics. Gold beats bitcoin for a longer track record. Overall I agree with their assessment. 



To estimate the true value of Bitcoin, we need to build upon Fidelity’s work. One weakness of this comparison chart is that some categories are more important than others. I have assigned an importance to each category below. This is subjective. Someone could make it more objective, but it would make the analysis more painstaking to complete and I don’t think my importance ratings will be majorly controversial anyway. 



The largest consequence of my importance ratings is that Gold is going to get a favourable comparison vs Bitcoin for winning the ‘track record’ category which has 65% importance. I think that is cautiously fair. The largest advantage of Gold is that it has been used as a store of value for over 2,500 years and I think track record is an important characteristic for most investors. Crypto investors evidently don’t care about track record, but outside of crypto a lot of investors do care. I have avoided making any dubious assumptions that benefit Bitcoin in this benchmarking analysis. I would prefer to make a confident estimate that ‘Bitcoin is worth at least X’ instead of a dubious claim that ‘Maybe Bitcoin could be worth up to X’. For example, I think I have been harsh on Bitcoin to say that ‘verifiable’ only has a 14% importance. This is an important characteristic and Bitcoin is much more verifiable than Gold. So my end calculation will under-value Bitcoin if you agree verifiable is actually more important than 14%.

Next I want to quantify the exact difference between Bitcoin and Gold given Fidelity’s ratings and my importance ratings. The first step is to assign arbitrary points for each category. The winner of a category gets 100 points, the loser gets zero points, and for a draw both Bitcoin and gold get 50 points each. Here is how the results look:




Bitcoin investors might be shouting ‘Stop the count!’ at this point because Bitcoin looks like a better store of value than Gold. But we have not considered the importance of each category just yet. Gold is going to perform much better once we factor in the importance of ‘track record’. To consider category importance, I calculated a weighted score by multiplying the points by importance. The results are shown below.



Bitcoin scores 26 vs gold 74 after we consider the importance of each category. This result is more meaningful if you put it into a percentage: Bitcoin is 35% as good as Gold as a store of value (26/74 = 35%). This 35% is a key figure that will be used to value Bitcoin in the remainder of this post. If you disagree with 35% that’s fine, you can replicate the steps below with a different figure. For example, if you think Bitcoin is half as good as Gold, you can use 50%. To estimate the value of one bitcoin we need to gather the remaining inputs for our calculation: (Market cap of Gold * % used for investing *  35%) / supply of bitcoin.

According to [Infinite Market Cap] the market cap of Gold is $13.7 trillion. The small print mentions that the market cap is the total value mined. What we are interested in is the market cap of Gold used for investing because that is the market Bitcoin is trying to capture. Bitcoin can’t be used for jewellery. According to [wikipedia] “The world's consumption of new gold produced is about 50% in jewellery, 40% in investments, and 10% in industry”. The exact percentages are debated because Gold reserves are not regularly audited (if at all). A few [other sources] tend to gravitate around a 40% figure. So we will stick with 40%. Lastly there is a maximum of 21 million bitcoin that will ever exist. Not all Bitcoin has been mined yet, and some has been lost. But I will use 21 million to err on the side of a pessimistic estimate.

Put this all together and you can estimate the value of one bitcoin as ($13.7 trillion * 0.40 * 0.35) / 21 million = $91,833.

I like this analysis for three reasons. (1) It is based on the value of Gold which is a moving target and Bitcoin has a real opportunity to capture some of this market. (2) The assumptions are pretty ‘safe’. I think the biggest underlying assumption is the belief that if Bitcoin is 35% as good as Gold it should also be worth 35% of the addressable market. (3) It passes the ‘eyeball test’. The logic makes sense and the end result is a believable number.

If someone wanted to, they could also repeat this process for other markets that Bitcoin could capture. For example Bitcoin might partly capture market share of the reserve currency market cap or the real estate investment market cap. Then you could add the Gold benchmark + reserve currency benchmark + real estate market benchmark to have a final number.

For now, I am content believing that one bitcoin is worth $92K which could deliver a 119% ROI for anyone buying at the current market price.

Btw, if anyone wants a minimalist website to track the price of bitcoin over the next bull market cycle, I made [DefiDive.com]

TLDR:

Valuation calculation vs gold =
(market cap of gold * percentage used for investing * percentage of market bitcoin should capture) / supply of bitcoin

= ($13.7 trillion * 0.40 * 0.35) / 21 million = $91,833.",0.028,0.815,0.157,0.9993

2. or should I just leave things as is and wait for the conversion?

Funding averages 3%/month from the few months data I have.

Assume 1 btc @ 44k. Rangebound for 1 month, expect to close below 44k and collect funding. 20% break to 53k, close 0.8 btc at 53k  = 42.4k, 3.6% loss covered by funding gain. 

Some sharp reaction post ETF to 40k or less gets 10% more bitcoin for halving party. 

It keeps the degen instinct in check too.

Even an overnight 50% break gives 33k (17%* loss before funding) which would suck. Any other flaws?
